// WP-00: stranded-upgrade recovery.
//
// the reporter's own install has been unable to accept a document since 2026-08-18
// because an upgrade died at the migrate step. 0.1.19 made that state VISIBLE
// (/health honestly reports accepting_documents: false while paused), but
// nothing on the CLI side ever read that field, and there was no dedicated
// path to actually resolve it: `brain doctor` never asked a deployed brain
// about its own state, only about the local machine's, and the closest thing
// to a repair path was reconstructing "run brain update again" out of the
// wall of text a failed upgrade printed.
//
// This file proves three things: the new probe correctly reads a live
// paused/active brain without needing a Cloudflare token when a domain is
// configured; the diagnosis enriches that with the exact stage, bookmark, and
// duration from D1; and the repair/rollback command resumes or restores
// safely, is a no-op preview without --yes, and refuses when it has no safe
// target. The final block is the acceptance criterion itself: a migration is
// deliberately killed mid-flight, `brain doctor`'s diagnosis detects it
// accurately, and the repair path returns the install to a working state
// with its corpus intact.
