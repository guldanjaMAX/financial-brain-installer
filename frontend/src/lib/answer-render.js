/**
 * answer-render — how a /think response becomes the two sentences an owner
 * reads, and the one thing those sentences must never say.
 *
 * These were fenced inside the served HTML so an offline test could lift them
 * out and exercise the real shipped source. That was the right instinct with a
 * hand-written page; once the app became a bundle there was no page to lift
 * them from, and the honest fix is a module both the app and the test import
 * rather than string surgery on a document.
 *
 * Pure and DOM-free on purpose: the rule they encode is a product rule, not a
 * rendering detail, and every surface that shows an answer needs it.
 *
 * THE RULE: an incomplete search must never render as "the documents do not
 * answer the question". That sentence asserts an absence, and on this page it
 * is all the owner sees. During the first hours of a new brain the index is
 * still building, which makes a degraded empty result the likeliest empty
 * result they will ever get. Saying "nothing is recorded" then is a confident
 * false claim about their own records, produced by the very discipline the
 * brain is sold on.
