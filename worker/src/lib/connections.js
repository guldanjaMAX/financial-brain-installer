// What can reach this brain right now, besides the owner's own devices.
//
// An owner asks this question about APPS ("is Claude still connected?"), not
// about tokens. A connector refreshes its token routinely, so a token list
// would show the same app several times and imply activity that is really just
// bookkeeping. Every row here is one app.
//
// Liveness is the delicate part. A token dies three ways, and only one of them
// writes to the row:
//
//   1. revoked_at set        — the owner disconnected it here
//   2. expires_at passed     — it aged out
//   3. session_generation is behind — "Sign out everywhere" bumped the counter
//
// The third leaves the row looking untouched. Listing it as connected would be
// exactly the wrong lie to tell on a page whose entire job is answering "who
// has access", so generation is part of the liveness test, not an afterthought.
