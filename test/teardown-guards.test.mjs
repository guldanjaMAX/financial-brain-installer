/**
 * The teardown script deletes a Worker, a D1 database and a Vectorize index.
 * Its two guards both failed open until 2026-09-03.
 *
 * The name check was /^brain-test|test/i, which alternates across the whole
 * pattern: "starts with brain-test, OR contains test anywhere". That made
 * `my-production-testbed` deletable, and `latest-greatest` too, because
 * "latest" contains t-e-s-t. The second lock read a comma-separated list from
 * the environment and, unset, was an empty array that protected nothing and
 * said nothing. Both were found by reading the script before adopting it.
