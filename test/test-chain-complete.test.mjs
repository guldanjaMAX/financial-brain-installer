/**
 * Every tracked test file is actually in the test chain.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `npm test` is a hardcoded `&&` chain of ~116 commands, not a
 * discovery run. That is a deliberate choice (explicit ordering, explicit
 * per-file node flags), and it has one failure mode that is worse than anything
 * it buys: a test file that exists, is committed, and is NOT in the chain is
 * invisible. It can fail for weeks and every run stays green.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `test/report-html.test.mjs` was tracked, was
 * failing, and was missing from the chain. It was found only because an agent
 * happened to run it directly. Nothing in the suite could have surfaced it,
 * because the suite did not know it existed.
 *
 * So this file asserts the one property the chain cannot assert about itself:
 * that it is complete. A new test file now either joins the chain or turns this
 * red on the next run.
 *
 * If you are here because this failed: the fix is to add the named file to
 * `scripts.test` in package.json, in a position that matches what it depends
 * on. Do NOT add it to the ignore list below to make this pass — that is the
 * same defect this file exists to end, with an extra step.
