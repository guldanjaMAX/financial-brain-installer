// test/bank-import-path.test.mjs
//
// THE PRODUCTION PATH FROM A DOWNLOADED BANK FILE TO A LEDGER ROW.
//
// The previous wave built a bank-export reader with 79 tests of its own and a
// ledger writer with 132, and shipped no way to get from one to the other. The
// parser tests all passed while `fin_transactions` stayed empty in every
// install, because nothing production ever called the parser for its FIGURES.
// That is the specific hole this file exists to make impossible to reopen, so
// almost nothing here is a unit test:
//
//   * a REAL fixture file on disk,
//   * through the REAL CLI command an operator types,
//   * over the REAL worker entry point, dispatched by the REAL router in
//     worker/src/index.js so a handler that exists but is not mounted fails,
//   * into a REAL SQLite database built from the REAL migration files,
//   * asserted by reading rows back out of it.
//
// The four properties underneath it, in the order they would cost money:
//
//   1. AN INVERTED OFX IS CAUGHT, NOT TRUSTED. The format's sign convention
//      used to be believed without ever being checked. A statement that states
//      its own opening balance now has to close, or nothing is imported.
//   2. A SECOND IMPORT OF THE SAME FILE DOES NOT DOUBLE THE LEDGER.
//   3. A FILE WHOSE DIRECTION CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED IS REFUSED BY NAME, and a
//      dry run sends nothing at all.
//   4. WHAT WAS NOT VERIFIED SAYS SO, in the ledger and not only on a terminal
//      that scrolled away.
//
// Every fixture, person and figure here is invented. No real person, client,
// institution or account number appears in this file or in anything it reads.
