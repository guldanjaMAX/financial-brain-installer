-- 0017_financial_ledger — the structured financial layer, in the client's own D1.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--
-- Fourteen migrations built a document corpus: text, chunks, keyword search,
-- source receipts, vector projection. A financial document ingested through
-- that path becomes searchable prose and nothing else. Prose cannot be added
-- up, cannot be compared against a bank feed, and cannot say which of two
-- disagreeing figures is which. So a client-facing screen that shows "what you
-- hold", "what is still missing for the month", or "these two sources disagree"
-- has nothing to read, and a clean install on a new household completes
-- successfully and opens an empty product. Nothing errors. There is simply
-- nothing in it.
--
-- These tables are the missing half. They hold financial FACTS, each one
-- traceable to the document or feed it came from.
--
-- THE SHAPE IS DERIVED, NOT INVENTED
--
-- Every table and nearly every enum here answers to a screen that already
-- exists in the client UI, and to the translation layer that already reads a
-- snapshot: the account coverage vocabulary, the deadline status and urgency
-- vocabularies, the exception fields, the open-item fields and the per-document
-- custody facts are the names that layer already consumes. Where this schema
-- adds a value the UI does not yet have (`unparsed`), it is because the UI has
-- no way to say "I could not read this", and inventing a number instead is the
-- single worst thing a financial system can do.
--
-- FIVE PROPERTIES THIS SCHEMA IS BUILT TO GUARANTEE
--
-- 1. TENANT ON EVERY TABLE, FROM THE FIRST MIGRATION. The recommended
--    deployment is one brain per client, which needs no tenant column at all.
--    It is here anyway, and every read filters on it, because the alternative
--    is a migration on a live financial ledger later. It costs nothing now.
--    Today every row carries 'primary'.
--
-- 2. PROVENANCE ON EVERY FACT. A figure whose origin cannot be named is not
--    evidence, it is a rumour with a dollar sign. Four origins are allowed and
--    two of them are constrained by the database rather than by convention: an
--    `extracted` row cannot exist without the document it was read from, and a
--    `feed` row cannot exist without naming the feed. The feed name doubles as
--    the scope key, so one equality match removes everything a connector wrote,
--    the same property `sources.name` gives the corpus.
--
-- 3. AN EXPLICIT UNPARSED STATE. `basis_state = 'unparsed'` means the extractor
--    could not read it. The CHECK constraints make that state incompatible with
--    carrying a figure: you cannot store a number you could not read. This is
--    the whole difference between a system that says "I could not read this"
--    and one that guesses.
--
-- 4. INTEGER MINOR UNITS, NEVER FLOATS, WITH THE CURRENCY. Every amount column
--    ends in `_minor` and every table that holds one names its currency. A
--    binary float cannot represent a cent, and a ledger that rounds is a ledger
--    that disagrees with a bank.
--
-- 5. RECONCILIATION AS A STATE, NOT A WINNER. The same account, the same
--    period, from two sources, is two rows and one comparison. The comparison
--    has its own state and can rest at `mismatched`. Nothing collapses to one
--    side, and an owner's ruling is recorded beside both figures rather than
--    overwriting either.
--
-- SUPERSESSION, NOT UPDATE
--
-- An owner-stated fact from the pre-install interview ("three business accounts,
-- opened around 2019") is useful and it is not evidence. When the real document
-- arrives it does not overwrite that row, it supersedes it: the new row is
-- written and the old one records who replaced it. `superseded_by_id IS NULL`
-- is the live-row predicate everywhere, enforced by a partial unique index on
-- each table's stable key. The chain is walkable backwards from the new row, so
-- the correction keeps its why.
--
-- NO FOREIGN KEYS ACROSS THESE TABLES, DELIBERATELY
--
-- Cross-table links use the stable text key (an entity slug, an account slug, a
-- document uid), not the integer rowid, because a superseding row is a NEW rowid
-- and every reference to the old one would dangle. SQLite cannot express
-- "references the live row of this key", so the join predicate lives in the read
-- path where it can be tested. `ON DELETE CASCADE` is additionally unwanted here:
-- financial history is tombstoned, never deleted.
--
-- DATES ARE CALENDAR TEXT, NOT EPOCH INTEGERS
--
-- The corpus stores instants as epoch milliseconds. A statement period boundary
-- is not an instant, it is a calendar fact, and folding one into a timezone-bearing
-- integer is how a July statement becomes a June one for anybody east of UTC. Every
-- date here is ISO-8601 TEXT, constrained in shape, and lexicographic comparison is
-- therefore chronological comparison.
--
-- EVERY STATEMENT IN THIS FILE IS INDEPENDENTLY IDEMPOTENT. D1's REST endpoint
-- commits per statement, so a crash mid-file must leave a resumable database.
-- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS and CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS only; no ALTER, and
-- no triggers, whose bodies are the one shape the statement splitter has
-- historically shredded.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- entities --
--
-- The entity map. Every other table hangs off a slug from here, because nearly
-- every financial category repeats per entity: one household with a business and
-- a rental already needs it, and an owner with sixteen locations across company
-- owned and franchised cannot be expressed without it at all. Adding this later
-- is a rewrite, so it is here first.
--
-- `relationship` exists because a counterparty is in the ledger for a reason
-- that is not ownership: the buyer of a sold business who still owes on the
-- note belongs in the records and does not belong in a list headed "your
-- businesses".

-- because a document can be known to exist without its text being in the brain,
-- and a client is better served by "the 2024 return is with your accountant and
-- takes about a week to get" than by silence.
--
-- WHAT THIS TABLE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HOLD: a client-facing status word. The
-- product's finished states, "Filed" and "Current", are two different finished
-- states and both are derivations over stored facts, not columns a connector
-- writes. Writing the word would make a script's success look like a custody
-- guarantee. So the FACTS behind the words live here (`custody_class`,

-- time, where the derivation can be tested.
--
-- `availability` is the owner's own vocabulary from the pre-install interview,
-- which happens before any file does: have it, can get it, do not have it. "Do
-- not have it" is a real and useful answer, not a failure.

-- THE SIGN CONVENTION, NORMALISED ONCE.
--
-- Bank feeds and paper statements disagree about what a positive number means:
-- one common feed convention is that a positive amount is money going OUT, which
-- is backwards from every accounting intuition and from most other sources. So
-- `amount_minor` is a MAGNITUDE, always non-negative, and `direction` carries
-- the meaning. The provider's number is kept verbatim in `raw_amount_minor`
-- beside the name of the convention it was written under, so a disagreement is
-- diagnosable instead of being an argument about which side is upside down. Get
-- this wrong and every figure the product produces is wrong with a confident

-- look like owner draws is a pattern, not a fact, and how they are recorded is a
-- professional's call.
--
-- Two: resolving an exception NEVER overwrites a source record. The resolution
-- is written here, on the exception, and the transaction it concerns is
-- untouched. That is why this table has no supersession chain: an exception is
-- resolved, not replaced, and the row it points at keeps its own history.
