/**
 * OCR policy: what counts as a read, what counts as garbage, and what a page

 *
 * No network and no model live in this file. It decides, and the decision is
 * deterministic, so the same pages produce the same verdict and the same
 * confidence number every time.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT
 *
 * `ingest/formats.mjs` refuses a scanned PDF rather than indexing it empty,
 * because a brain that holds a document it can say nothing about is worse than
 * one that admits the document never arrived. OCR removes that refusal, and in
 * doing so introduces a WORSE failure than an empty document: a wrong one.
 *
 * A vision model asked to look at a page defaults to DESCRIBING it. "This
 * appears to be a bank statement showing several transactions" is fluent
 * English, passes every text-quality check in this repo, and is a complete
 * fabrication of a document nobody transcribed. Indexed, it would be cited,
 * with a page number, as though someone had read it.
 *
 * So OCR output is guarded twice. Once here, before anything is indexed, by
 * rules that look for the specific ways a transcription fails. And once in the
 * corpus, where every OCR'd document is MARKED as OCR and carries a confidence
 * that travels all the way into the citation. A blurry read must never look
 * identical to a clean one.
