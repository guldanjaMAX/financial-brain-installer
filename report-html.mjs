/**
 * report-html: the one file we hand a client.
 *
 *   brain test <manifest> --report brain-report.html
 *
 * This is four things at once, which is why it gets the care it gets.
 *
 *   As a GATE it is what the operator reads at T-2 before anything ships. Not the
 *   pass/fail line: the actual answers to the client's actual questions.
 *   A green suite over answers nobody read is a green suite over nothing.
 *
 *   As a KICKOFF it replaces the terminal. The client opens a browser and the
 *   first thing they see is their own ten questions answered with sources,
 *   which is the difference between "impressive technology" and "it knows my
 *   business".
 *
 *   As an ACCEPTANCE DELIVERABLE it is the record of what was true on handoff
 *   day, including what was missing.
 *
 *   As the ANSWER TO "is it installed yet" it is proof they can re-run
 *   themselves, forever, after our token is revoked.
 *
 * Constraints that follow from that last sentence, and are not negotiable:
 *
 *   ONE FILE. No CDN, no webfont, no image host, no script. It has to open
 *   from a thumb drive, on a plane, in five years, on a machine that has never
 *   heard of us. Everything here is inline and static.
 *
 *   EVERY INTERPOLATION IS REDACTED THEN ESCAPED. The content is the client's
 *   own documents, which means it is untrusted input to this renderer. A
 *   document titled with a script tag must render as text, and a document that
 *   somehow carries an API key must not put it in a file that then gets
 *   emailed around. The ingest gate is the first defense and this is the
 *   second, implemented separately on purpose: two independent checks fail
 *   independently, one shared helper fails once for both.
 *
 * The rendering half is pure and synchronous so it can be tested without a
 * live install. Collection is separate and does the network.
