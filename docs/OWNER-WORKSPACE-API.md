# Owner workspace API contract

This document freezes the backend contract introduced by D1 migration 0021.
All routes use JSON `POST`, return `Cache-Control: no-store`, and require both a
valid passkey session and `X-Brain-App: 1`. The session must resolve positively
to `{ kind: "owner", grantId: null }`. There is no admin-key fallback.

Missing or invalid sessions return `401 {"error":"unauthorized","code":"session_required"}`.
A live scoped principal returns `403 {"error":"forbidden","code":"owner_required"}`.
Unavailable authorization or storage fails closed with a stable `503` code.

## Source coverage

`POST /api/app/system` returns each registered source with four independent
coverage dimensions. The owner app uses these fields instead of turning one
successful refresh or one global percentage into a complete-history claim.

```json
{
  "label": "Email",
  "documents": 66000,
  "coverage": {
    "starter_context": { "state": "ready" },
    "live_updates": { "state": "catching_up" },
    "history": { "state": "running" },
    "meaning_search": { "state": "projecting" },
    "confirmed_range": { "from": null, "through": null },
    "target_range": { "from": null, "through": null },
    "current_window": null,
    "counts": { "seen": null, "accepted": null, "refused": null, "failed": null },
    "last_progress_at": "2026-09-06T10:00:00.000Z",
    "projection_pending": null,
    "waiting_on_owner_machine": false
  }
}
```

`unknown` means the stored evidence cannot prove a dimension. It is never
coerced to ready. The exact whole-brain Vectorize readiness check settles an
unknown meaning-search state conservatively: any unresolved global debt keeps
the source in `projecting`. Per-source pending counts stay null until the
priority outbox has a cheap durable aggregate, avoiding a full outbox scan on
every owner page load. Historical completeness still requires a complete
source sweep; a recent incremental receipt cannot create it.

## Shared write envelope

Every write requires `request_id`, 1 to 128 letters, digits, underscores, or
hyphens. Successful write responses contain:

```json
{
  "request_id": "stable retry identity",
  "entity_scope": { "entity_slug": "owned-entity-or-null" },
  "changed": true,
  "activity_event_id": "event id or null",
  "replayed": false
}
```

An exact retry returns the stored result with `replayed:true`, HTTP 200, and no
second domain write or activity event. Reusing a request ID with a different
normalized request returns HTTP 409 with `code:"request_id_conflict"`.

Writes are refused with HTTP 503 and `code:"owner_writes_paused"` while
`VECTOR_DRAIN_MODE=paused-for-upgrade`.

An owned entity is a live `fin_entities` row with `relationship="owned"`.
Unknown entities return 404. Counterparties return 403. Database failures
return 503 and never fall through to a broader scope.

## Upload

`POST /api/owner/uploads/capabilities` accepts `{}` and declares the backend's
exact MIME, extension, encoding, and byte limits. Current support is:

- `text/plain` with `.txt`
- `text/markdown` with `.md` or `.markdown`
- strict UTF-8, with one leading UTF-8 BOM removed
- 1,000,000 UTF-8 content bytes

Empty or unknown MIME types, PDFs, images, Office files, RTF, email containers,
archives, and binary files return HTTP 415. Full binary upload remains blocked
on a separately reviewed storage and extraction architecture.

`POST /api/owner/uploads` request:

```json
{
  "request_id": "upload_attempt_1",
  "document_id": "stable_document_identity",
  "entity_slug": "owned_entity",
  "media_type": "text/plain",
  "file_name": "notes.txt",
  "envelope": {
    "content": "text",
    "title": "optional title",
    "metadata": {}
  }
}
```

`document_id` is stable across retries and later versions of the same logical
document. `request_id` identifies one attempted write only. Clients must not
send `envelope.source_type` or `envelope.source_id`. The server binds:

- `source_type = "upload"`
- `source_id = "owner:{entity_slug}:{document_id}"`
- authoritative `metadata.entity_slug = entity_slug`
- legacy Vectorize candidate metadata `client = entity_slug`

The resulting corpus identity is `upload:owner:{entity_slug}:{document_id}`.
Every accepted upload passes through the common ingest scanner, provenance,
chunking, and store path. Created or updated content emits one event only after
the store succeeds. Identical content is `unchanged` and emits no event.

The route persists a bounded pending intent before common ingest. A retry after
ingest committed but before receipt finalization resumes that intent, returns
HTTP 200 with the original action and `replayed:true`, and finalizes exactly one
event. A scanner rejection removes the pending intent and leaves no receipt or
event.

## Approvals

`POST /api/owner/approvals` supports:

```json
{
  "request_id": "ruling_1",
  "entity_slug": "owned_entity",
  "approval_type": "reconciliation_ruling",
  "subject_uid": "reconciliation_uid",
  "selected_claim_uid": "claim_uid",
  "note": "optional"
}
```

```json
{
  "request_id": "exception_1",
  "entity_slug": "owned_entity",
  "approval_type": "exception_resolution",
  "subject_uid": "exception_uid",
  "resolution": "required resolution",
  "note": "optional"
}
```

The reconciliation write updates the served `fin_reconciliations` row while
preserving both claims and appends `owner_approvals`. The exception write
updates the served `fin_exceptions` row without changing its transaction.
Approval and activity rows are append-only in SQL.

## Period close

- `POST /api/owner/period-closes/read`
- `POST /api/owner/period-closes/accept`
- `POST /api/owner/period-closes/reopen`

Read accepts `{entity_slug,period_start?,period_end?}`. A healthy empty result
contains `period_closes:[]`. An unavailable read omits the collection and names
`sections_unavailable:["period_closes"]`.

Accept and reopen require `request_id`, `entity_slug`, `period_start`, and
`period_end`. Accept may include `acknowledge_incomplete:true`. Evidence failure
returns 503 without a write. Incomplete evidence returns 409 unless explicitly
acknowledged.

The response keeps decision and evidence orthogonal:

```json
{
  "period_close": {
    "period_close_id": "id",
    "status": "accepted",
    "evidence_state": "complete",
    "acknowledged_incomplete": false
  }
}
```

`status` is `accepted` or `reopened`. `evidence_state` is `complete` or
`owner_acknowledged_incomplete`. Re-acceptance derives evidence state from the
current evidence snapshot, not from an older acceptance.

## Activity

`POST /api/owner/activity` accepts `{entity_slug?,limit?,cursor?}` and returns
an append-only page under `activity_events`. Each row uses `event_type`,
`entity_slug`, `subject_kind`, `subject_id`, `display_label`, and `occurred_at`.

The one human history includes upload, approval, close, target, preference,
document-grant create/invite-reissue/revoke, and passkey/device changes. Shared
security writers use `document_grant_created`,
`document_grant_invite_reissued`, `document_grant_revoked`, `passkey_added`,
`passkey_renamed`, `passkey_revoked`, and `sessions_revoked` only after a
successful non-replayed state change. The history never contains document
content, questions, answers, credentials, credential IDs, raw errors, IP
addresses, user agents, or low-level allow/deny telemetry. Security telemetry
remains separate.

## Targets and preferences

Targets:

- `POST /api/owner/targets/read` with `{entity_slug}`
- `POST /api/owner/targets/upsert`
- `POST /api/owner/targets/archive`

Metrics are `revenue`, `cash_reserve`, `spending_limit`, `debt_reduction`, or
`other`. Money is a safe integer in minor units with a three-letter currency.
Identical upserts and repeated archives return `changed:false` and emit no event.

Preferences:

- `POST /api/owner/preferences/read` with `{entity_slug?}`
- `POST /api/owner/preferences/set`

Supported keys are `default_entity`, `display_currency`,
`fiscal_year_start_month`, and `activity_window_days`. Scope and value rules are
enforced by the backend. Setting an identical value returns `changed:false` and
emits no event.

## Entity-scoped Explore and Ask

`POST /api/rag/unified` and `POST /api/rag/think` accept `entity_slug` in the
private JSON body. D1 validates a live owned entity, then applies exact
`documents.entity_slug` equality to keyword search and vector hydration.

Migration 0021 backfills this authority only from an unambiguous live
`fin_documents.corpus_doc_uid` mapping. It never infers authority from the
free-form legacy `documents.client` label. Unmapped or ambiguous legacy rows
remain `NULL` and owner-only.

Vectorize does not yet have canonical entity metadata. The legacy client value
is used only as a candidate hint, never as a D1 predicate. Every scoped response
therefore reports `degraded:"vector"` and
`degraded_reason:"entity-vector-authority-unindexed"` until the canonical
metadata index is built and reprojected. A scoped semantic miss cannot appear
as a healthy empty result.
