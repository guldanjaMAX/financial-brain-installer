 *

 * spend and un-bound the cap for as long as D1 was unhappy. A cap that fails
 * open is not a cap. On a client-owned install the payment method behind it is
 * the client's, so the failure mode was somebody else's bill.
 *
 * It does not fail fully closed either. Refusing every answer because a logging
 * table hiccuped is its own kind of broken, and to the client it looks like the
 * brain is down. So the guard degrades: it falls back to what THIS isolate
 * knows it has spent and holds that against a small fraction of the day's
 * budget. Answers keep flowing through a blip; a loop hits the floor fast and
 * stops. Unbounded spend is unreachable in every branch, because the isolate
 * ledger only ever grows and is never replaced by a zero.
 *
 * The honest limit, stated rather than glossed: the degraded bound is per
 * isolate, not global. A runaway loop lives in one isolate and is bounded
 * exactly. Broad fan-out across many isolates while D1 is down is bounded only
 * by (isolates x reduced allowance), which is far tighter than "no cap" but is
