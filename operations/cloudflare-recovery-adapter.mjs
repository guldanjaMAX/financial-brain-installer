 * Supervised live adapter for the disposable Cloudflare recovery field gate.
 *
 * This file can export the reviewed source D1 database and write only to an
 * already-provisioned target whose D1, Vectorize, Worker, and hostname all carry
 * one explicit recovery-gate nonce. It cannot create, upload, route, or destroy
 * a resource. Its only deployment mutation promotes one separately reviewed,
 * immutable active version after a paused version has completed the exact
 * Vectorize rebuild. Cloudflare control-plane credentials stay inside an
 * owner-only wrapper such as a macOS Keychain-backed Wrangler launcher. The
 * Brain admin key is read from the target manifest's exact Keychain locator and
 * is used only in request headers or evaluator stdin.
