// PRIVACY GATE for a PUBLIC repository. One file, three jobs:
//
//   1. PACKAGE INVENTORY. `npm pack --dry-run` must produce exactly the
//      reviewed file list in `expected` below, plus the four reviewed bundled
//      dependencies. package.json has to use directory entries for npm's
//      packer, so this list is the real allowlist: a new file under one of
//      those directories fails here until a reviewer names it deliberately.
//   2. IDENTITY SCAN. Every tracked or new candidate file, plus every file npm would
//      ship, is read and checked for private identity. Candidate and packed
//      PATHS are checked with the same rules, because a first name reached
//      this repo inside a FILENAME once, where no content scan could see it.
//   3. TARBALL SANITY. The tarball is really built, unpacked, and one module
//      imported out of it, so a packlist that names every file and still hides
//      a broken relative import fails.
//
// SCOPE OF THE IDENTITY SCAN, stated once and correctly: it covers ALL FILES
// TRACKED BY GIT plus new non-ignored candidates, union the npm packlist. It
// is deliberately NOT an allowlist of directories. The version this replaced
// walked only `test/` and `worker/test/` and was therefore blind to 125 of 427
// tracked files, `evidence/` being the largest unwatched block. Leaks were then
// found across `evidence/`, `docs/`, both test trees and a shipped source
// comment, every one of them by hand, because nothing automated was looking.
// Enumerating from git means a directory added tomorrow is covered the day it
// is proposed, with nobody having to remember this file. Exactly two local
// coordination notes, root HANDOFF.md and WORKLOG.md, are excluded only while
// untracked. Tracking or packaging either remains forbidden.
//
// WHY EVERY TRACKED FILE AND NOT JUST THE PACKAGE: this repo is public on
// GitHub. Every committed file is readable by anyone, and git history keeps it
// readable after a later commit deletes it. A private name reaching any
// tracked path is a real exposure the moment it is pushed, whether or not
// `npm install` would ever deliver it.
//
// WHEN THIS RUNS: only under `npm test`. There are no git hooks in this repo
// and this file does not install one, because that is the repository owner's
// call to make on his own machine. docs/privacy-gate.md has the exact opt-in
// command, and what it costs, for anyone who wants it on pre-commit.
//
// TWO MODES. Run with no arguments it does all three jobs above, in about four
// seconds, over half of it spent in two `npm pack` invocations. Run with
// `--scan-only` it does job 2 alone in about two seconds, which is the right
// shape for a pre-commit hook.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE DENYLIST, AND THE PARADOX IT HAS TO SURVIVE
//
// To detect a private string you have to be able to recognise it, and the
// obvious way to do that is to write it down. That made the previous version
// of this file the single densest concentration of real identity in the whole
// repo: eight real names, an organisation and a personal email address, in
// plaintext, in a public repository, sitting under a comment explaining that
// they were private. It then had to exclude itself from its own scan to stay
// green, so the one file guaranteed to contain private identity was the one
// file never checked.
//
// So the values below are stored as SHA-256 digests of their normalised form.
// The plaintext is not in this file, not in the repo, and not in git history.
// This file is no longer excluded from its own scan, and there are no
// exemptions anywhere in this gate.
//
// WHAT HASHING ACTUALLY BUYS, honestly: it defeats reading, grepping, GitHub
// code search and search-engine indexing. Those are the realistic ways a name
// in a public repo gets found, so this is a real improvement and not a
// gesture. It does NOT defeat a guess. SHA-256 of a short lowercase first name
// is recoverable in seconds by anyone who hashes a name dictionary, so treat
// this as "you cannot read the list, you can only test a name you already
// suspect". A confirmation oracle is a much smaller leak than a printed list,
// and it is the best available trade here, because a denylist that cannot
// recognise the string cannot do its job at all.
//
// HOW A ROW IS MATCHED. Text is normalised by turning every run of
// non-alphanumeric characters into a single space, so `a.b.com`, `a/b`, `a_b`
// and `a b` all normalise identically. That is what lets a two-word rule catch
// a domain inside a URL and a one-word rule catch a name inside a filesystem
// path, which plain `\bName\b` word boundaries cannot do.
//
//   mode "word"  the match must be whole words in the normalised text. This is
//                what `\bName\b` used to mean. Short names need it: the
//                three-letter client first name below occurs as a substring of
//                ordinary English words such as "timeline" and "delivery".
//   mode "any"   the match may be any substring, so a value glued into a
//                larger identifier is still caught (a name inside a camelCase
//                variable, a host inside a longer host). Only long, distinctive
//                values are given this mode, where a coincidence is impossible.
//   cs true      the row is case-sensitive. Used for one short organisation
//                name that is also an everyday CSS property word in lowercase.
//
// WHY EXACT VALUES AND NOT SHAPES for the infrastructure ids. A rule matching
// "any 32 hex characters" would fire on this repo's own git SHAs, on dozens of
// deliberately synthetic fixtures, and on every content hash in
// docs/release-evidence/, i.e. it would be pure noise and would be switched off
// within a week. Hashing the handful of real ids that have actually leaked into
// this tree keeps a precise rule with a zero false-positive rate.
//
// ADDING OR ROTATING A ROW without ever typing the value into a file:
//   printf %s 'the value' | node test/package-privacy.test.mjs --hash word ci 'label'
// It prints the row to paste in. Piping from `printf` keeps the value out of
// shell history in a way an argument would not. Full notes in
// docs/privacy-gate.md.
