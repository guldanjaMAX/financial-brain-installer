/**
 * The financial ledger: schema guarantees and the read path, against a REAL
 * SQLite database.
 *
 * Mocks cannot prove a CHECK constraint, and every safety property this schema
 * claims is a CHECK constraint. So this file applies the actual migration files
 * in order to an in-memory SQLite database and then drives the exported query
 * functions through a thin D1-shaped adapter over the same database. A test that
 * asserts against a hand-built `{DB:{prepare}}` mock proves the mock.
 *
 * Every fixture person and business here is invented. No real client, bank,
