 * Until schema 15 this question had one answer: whoever held ADMIN_KEY could
 * do everything, and everyone else was rejected. That is fine for one person
 * and wrong for a household with a bookkeeper, which is the product.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here.
 *
 * Fail closed by omission. A route that nobody has classified requires
 * `administer`, so a route added next year is owner-only until somebody
 * decides otherwise. The dangerous default is the permissive one, and it is
 * the one you get for free if you are not deliberate.
 *
 * A missing grant is never the owner. The owner is identified positively, by
 * holding ADMIN_KEY or by a passkey enrolled before grants existed. Anything
 * that merely fails to name a grant resolves to nothing, because the opposite
 * reading turns every gap in the code into a privilege escalation.
