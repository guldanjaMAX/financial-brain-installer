/**
 * fin-import — the ONE write boundary into the structured financial ledger.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS EXACTLY ONE
 *
 * Two sources feed this ledger: a file the owner downloaded from their bank
 * (OFX, QFX, CSV) and a hosted read-only feed. The two disagree about almost
 * everything at the edges, and most sharply about SIGN: one of them writes a
 * negative number when money leaves an account and the other writes a positive
 * one. If each source wrote its own rows, the convention would live in two
 * places, and the day they drifted apart every figure the product shows would
 * be wrong while every citation still resolved.
 *
 * So both sources normalise BEFORE they get here, into one envelope carrying an
 * unsigned `amountMinor` and an explicit `direction`, and this module is the
 * only thing that turns that envelope into rows. The signed source figure and
 * the NAME of the convention it came from travel with it into
 * `raw_amount_minor` / `raw_sign_convention`, so a disagreement is diagnosable
 * rather than merely wrong.
 *
 * THREE PROPERTIES THIS MODULE GUARANTEES
 *
 * 1. NOTHING LANDS WITHOUT PROVENANCE. Every row names the document or the feed
 *    it came from, and where inside it. The schema already refuses an
 *    `extracted` row with no document and a `feed` row with no feed; this module
 *    never tries.
 * 2. WHAT COULD NOT BE READ LANDS AS UNREAD. A line whose amount or date the
 *    parser could not resolve becomes a row with `basis_state = 'unparsed'`, a
 *    reason, and NO figure. It is not dropped, because a dropped line makes the
 *    month look smaller rather than incomplete.
 * 3. THE SAME FILE TWICE IS THE SAME LEDGER. Every identifier written here is
 *    derived from content, not from time or from insert order, so re-importing
 *    a file — or importing next month's export that overlaps last month's —
 *    updates rows in place instead of doubling them.
 *
 * No credential is read, written, or joined here. Access references live in
 * connector-owned tables and never enter the ledger.
 */

/**
 * What counts as money you HOLD.
 *
 * A card, a loan or a line of credit is money OWED, and the ledger schema
 * refuses by CHECK to record one as an asset. A checking or savings account is
 * money held. Everything else is `neither`, which is the honest value for an
 * account whose kind a source did not state: an unknown account must not be
 * counted as cash on the strength of a default. Both readers — the downloaded
 * file and the hosted feed — call this one function, because a second copy of
 * this rule is how a client's debts end up inflating their net position.
