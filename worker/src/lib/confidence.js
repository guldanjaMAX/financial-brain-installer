// confidence.js — turn signals the answer pipeline already computes into one
// honest, displayable number.
//
// The owner asked the obvious question about every answer: "how much should I
// trust this?" The pipeline already knows: the evidence gate verified the
// citations, retrieval knows how many independent documents agree and whether
// their dates are reliable, and the gap computation knows what the corpus is
// blind to. This module only AGGREGATES those signals; it never invents a
// judgement of its own and it never calls a model.
//
// The percentage is a DETERMINISTIC RUBRIC SCORE, not a calibrated
// probability. Same inputs, same number, every time — which is what makes it
// honest to show: the basis list states exactly which signals produced it, so
// a reader can disagree with the rubric rather than with an oracle. It is
// clamped below 95 because retrieval over a private corpus can never prove
// completeness, and above 5 because a gated, cited answer is never worthless.
//
// Two shapes, one contract:
//   computeAnswerConfidence — for an answer that SURVIVED the evidence gate.
//   refusalConfidence       — for "nothing recorded": how sure are we that the
//                             absence is real rather than a blind spot.
//
// The result rides the /think response as a structured `confidence` field and
// is rendered by the CLI as its own line. It is deliberately NOT woven into
// the answer text: the eval's refusal scorer requires every clause of a
// refusal to read as a refusal, and a dozen worker tests pin the canonical
// refusal sentence verbatim. The answer string stays canonical; trust
// metadata travels beside it.
