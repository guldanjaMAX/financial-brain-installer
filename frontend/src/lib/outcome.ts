/** The five words this product is allowed to say about a thing's state.
 *
 *  Adopted from the reference prototype. The value is not the words themselves, it is
 *  that the set is CLOSED and each member carries a glyph:
 *
 *   - Closed, so a screen cannot invent a sixth state that means almost the
 *     same as one that exists. Five words an owner learns once beat twenty
 *     they have to keep re-reading.
 *   - Glyphed, so status survives grayscale, colour blindness, a bad screen,
 *     and print. Colour carries NO information here; it only reinforces what
 *     the glyph and the word already say.
 *
 *  Filed and Current are both finished, and they are not the same finished:
 *  Filed means the thing is done and put away, Current means it is up to date
 *  as of now. Collapsing them loses the distinction an owner actually asks
 *  about. */
