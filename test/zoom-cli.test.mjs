// test/zoom-cli.test.mjs
//
// The `brain connect zoom` / `brain disconnect zoom` wiring, driven the way
// test/imessage-ingest.test.mjs drives iMessage: the REAL command functions
// against the REAL connector module, with only the outside world faked. Zoom
// is a scripted fetch; Cloudflare's secret PUT/DELETE is a recording closure;
// and the live webhook check is pointed at the REAL worker route handler, so
// the CLI, the connector and the worker are all proven to agree end to end.
//
// The assertions that matter most here are about ORDER, not output. Zoom
// validates a webhook URL at the moment it is saved, so a wizard that printed
// that URL before the worker was verifiably holding the secret would send the
// client into an opaque Zoom-side failure. Several tests below exist only to
// prove that nothing is written and no URL is printed until each earlier gate
// has passed.
//
// What this cannot prove is stated in evidence/WP-08.md rather than implied
// away: no test here has ever spoken to Zoom.
