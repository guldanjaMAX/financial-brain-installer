        <Note>
          Whoever installed this brain used an operator key. It is a different
          key from every device above, so removing a device does not touch it,
          and neither does signing out everywhere. Anyone holding it can enroll
          a new device here at any time. If that happens, it shows up in your
          device list as one you did not add, and that is the only trace this
          brain can give you.
        </Note>
        <Note>
          Your move, and it is a real one: ask your installer to rotate that key
          and tell you the date they did it. A rotated key makes every old copy
          dead. That is stronger than a promise the key was destroyed, because
          it is something that actually happens to the brain rather than
          something someone says.
