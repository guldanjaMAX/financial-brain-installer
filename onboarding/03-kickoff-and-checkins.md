# Kickoff and the three weeks after

One 60 minute session, then three 15 minute check-ins a week apart.

The first half of this document is the agenda the client sees. The second half is my facilitation notes and is not for the client.

# Part 1: Kickoff, 60 minutes

## Before we start

Nothing to install, nothing to prepare. Bring the ten questions you wrote at intake, because they are the agenda.

You are not going to watch me type into a terminal. You are going to read a report about your own business, and then take the controls.

## The hour

| Time | What happens | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| **0:00 to 0:05** | What you are looking at, and where it lives | Listen |
| **0:05 to 0:25** | Your ten questions, answered, with sources | Read. Interrupt whenever something is wrong |
| **0:25 to 0:35** | What it does not know, including the two you predicted it would miss | Decide which gaps matter to you |
| **0:35 to 0:42** | One question that no keyword search could have assembled | Watch, then try to break it |
| **0:42 to 0:52** | Connect it to your own AI tools, on your own machine | You type. I stay quiet |
| **0:52 to 1:00** | I remove my access, live, and we re-run the full check with me locked out | Watch the screen |

## 0:00, what you are looking at

Your brain runs inside accounts you own. It read the material you pointed it at and nothing else. I hold no copy of any of it.

You will see one report. Everything in it was produced by running live checks against your own infrastructure, and you can produce the same report yourself at any time, including after today.

## 0:05, your ten questions

These are the questions you wrote at intake, in your words, not tidied up. Each answer carries bracketed numbers that map to the documents it came from.

**Interrupt.** If an answer is wrong, say so in the moment. A wrong answer found today costs ten minutes. Found in month two, it costs your trust in the whole thing.

## 0:25, what it does not know

This is the part most tools do not show you.

Two of these are the failures you predicted at intake. We look at them on purpose, next to the answers that worked, because a tool that tells you what it does not know is worth more than one that always sounds confident.

Some gaps are fixable, meaning the material exists and needs connecting. Some are not, meaning the answer was never written down anywhere, by anyone. You will be able to tell them apart by the end of this segment, and that distinction is worth more than any single answer.

## 0:35, the question you could not have googled

One question whose answer is assembled from several documents that do not mention each other. This is the thing that separates it from search.

Then try to break it. Genuinely. Ask something you think it should get and see what happens.

## 0:42, your turn

I hand you a configuration block. You paste it once, and your own AI tools can ask your own brain, from your own machine, in any folder you work in.

Then you ask it something. Not one of the ten. Something you thought of this morning.

This is the moment it stops being a system I showed you and becomes a thing you own.

## 0:52, I remove my access

Live, on the screen, with you watching.

I delete the token I have been using. Then we run the full verification suite again, with me locked out of your account, and it passes exactly as it did five minutes earlier.

That is the promise made physical instead of claimed. No vendor with a hosted product can perform that demonstration at any price, because their access is the product.

Afterwards I hand you the handoff letter: what was revoked, what you own, how to run it without me, and how to delete all of it if you ever want to.

# Part 2: The three check-ins

Fifteen minutes each, one week apart. Same time each week. They are short on purpose and they are not status updates.

## Check-in 1, day 15: what did it get wrong

| Time | What happens |
|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:08 | **You** show me three real questions you asked this week and what came back |
| 0:08 to 0:13 | I tell you which are fixable and which are gaps in your own records |
| 0:13 to 0:15 | The one thing I change before next week |

Bring failures, not compliments. A week of real use finds things no test suite does, and this is the only session where that material is still fresh.

## Check-in 2, day 22: did the fixes land

| Time | What happens |
|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:05 | We re-ask last week's three failures |
| 0:05 to 0:10 | The rest of your material has finished loading. We look at one line per source, and what that changed |
| 0:10 to 0:15 | Your first monthly report, walked through line by line |

By now the long tail of your material is in, so questions that returned thin answers in week one often return real ones. We check that rather than assume it.

## Check-in 3, day 29: you run it

| Time | What happens |
|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:05 | **You** run the verification suite yourself, on your machine, while I watch |
| 0:05 to 0:10 | You read the output and tell me what it says. I correct nothing unless you ask |
| 0:10 to 0:15 | What the monthly rhythm looks like from here, and how to reach me |

This one is a test, and it is a test of me rather than of you. If you cannot run and read your own verification without me on the call, then you do not really own this yet, and I have more work to do.

You also leave with the runbook: the ten things most likely to go wrong, what each one looks like, and the exact command that fixes it.

# Internal notes. Not for the client.

Update [the client onboarding scorecard](./10-client-onboarding-scorecard.md)
during kickoff and each check-in. Keep customer content in the private manifest
and acceptance receipts; put only opaque IDs and aggregate measurements in the
scorecard.

## Before the kickoff call

Have open, in this order, and nothing else visible:

1. The report, already rendered, already read by you in full.
2. The manifest, in a window you are not sharing.
3. A terminal, minimized. It does not appear until 0:42.
4. The Cloudflare token page, logged in, on the token you are about to delete.
5. The handoff letter, filled in, ready to send the moment the session ends.

**Do not open a terminal before 0:42.** A terminal is the single fastest way to turn a business owner into a spectator. The report is the artifact; the terminal is the proof, and proof comes after belief, not before.

## The rule for the whole hour

You have already read every answer. Nothing in this session should surprise you. The day 7 gate exists precisely so that the first time an answer is read aloud is not the first time it has been read.

**If an answer is wrong in the room, say it is wrong.** Do not explain it away, do not reach for context, do not say "well, what it means is". Name it, write it down, move on. The whole product is built on stating what it does not know. Defending a bad answer in the first hour undoes the thing you are selling.

Confidence that this posture outperforms recovery-by-explanation: 0.9. It is also the only posture consistent with the rest of the offer.

## 0:25, the gap segment

Show the two predicted failures deliberately and name them as predicted. Calibration is the point: they told you at intake what they expected it to fumble, and being right about that is evidence the system is honest rather than evidence it is weak.

Separate the two kinds of gap out loud:

- **Connectable.** The material exists, in a source not yet wired up, or in a file type not read. This is a scope conversation, and it is a real one.
- **Never written down.** No system can retrieve a decision that only ever happened in a hallway. Say this plainly. It is often the most valuable thing they hear all hour, because it changes how they run their business rather than how they use the tool.

## 0:42, the MCP handoff

Let them type. Resist correcting the first command. A ten second fumble they resolve themselves is worth more than a flawless demo you drive.

Do not use one of the ten questions here. Those are yours to have prepared. This one has to be theirs, unrehearsed, or the moment does not land.

## 0:52, the revocation

**Actually delete the token.** Not a screenshot, not a description, not "and then I would delete this". If it is simulated, do not perform it at all, because a demonstration they later discover was theater is worse than never running it.

Then re-run the suite with the token gone. It passes because nothing in the running install depends on your access, which is the entire architectural claim.

Say the trade out loud before they ask: **from this moment, if something needs my hands, they issue a fresh temporary token and revoke it again when the work is done.** That is a real cost of the custody model and naming it here beats discovering it in week two.

Have the replacement path ready in writing in the handoff letter, so "how do I get you back in" already has an answer.

## Check-in 1 will run long. Let it.

It is scheduled for 15 minutes and it will go to 30 if they bring real material, which is the outcome you want. This is the session where the monthly stops being a line item and becomes obviously worth paying, because it is the first time they have watched something they found get fixed.

Do not cut it short to protect the calendar. Book a 30 minute hold and end early if there is nothing.

## What to listen for across all three

- **They stopped using it after day 3.** The most important signal available, and it never arrives as a complaint. Ask directly: how many times did you ask it something this week. Zero is a finding, not an insult.
- **They only ask their original ten.** Means it has not entered their workflow. The fix is usually a habit prompt tied to something they already do weekly, not a feature.
- **Every failure is one connector away.** If two of the three weekly failures point at the same missing source, that is the next sale and you should price it, not build it for free.
- **They cannot run the suite at check-in 3.** Do not paper over it by running it for them. Fix the instructions and run the check-in again. Custody they cannot exercise is custody they do not have.
