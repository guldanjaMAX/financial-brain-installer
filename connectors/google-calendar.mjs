/**
 * Google Calendar connector.
 *
 * Turns a client's calendars into brain documents. Calendar is connective
 * tissue: the brain already holds transcripts and email but is INFERRING the
 * relationship graph from them. Calendar hands it over directly, with dates
 * and attendee lists that are structured rather than guessed.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * VERIFIED AGAINST GOOGLE'S DOCS, 2026-08-16. Each of these changed the design.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1. `calendar.events.readonly` is SENSITIVE, not restricted, so no CASA
 *    assessment and no annual re-audit. Google's own sensitive-scope page uses
 *    "reading events stored in Google Calendar" as its worked example, and
 *    projects requesting only sensitive scopes are exempt from the third-party
 *    security assessment.
 *
 * 2. `calendar.events.readonly` does NOT authorize `calendarList.list`. That
 *    endpoint accepts only calendar.readonly, calendar, calendar.calendarlist
 *    and calendar.calendarlist.readonly. So at minimum scope the connector
 *    CANNOT discover which calendars exist. Calendars are therefore explicit
 *    config, defaulting to "primary". Asking for calendarList would widen the
 *    scope past the minimum for the sake of a convenience we do not need,
 *    since the intake call already establishes which calendars matter.
 *
 * 3. syncToken may not be combined with iCalUID, orderBy,
 *    privateExtendedProperty, q, sharedExtendedProperty, timeMin, timeMax or
 *    updatedMin. Sending one is a 400, and every other parameter must stay
 *    identical to the initial request or the behaviour is undefined. That is
 *    why config changes force a resync (see PARAM FINGERPRINT below).
 *
 * 4. syncToken forbids showDeleted=false outright: "All events deleted since
 *    the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not
 *    allowed to set showDeleted to False." So showDeleted is pinned true on
 *    BOTH the full and the incremental sync. It is not a preference.
 *
 * 5. A 410 means the sync token is dead (reason `fullSyncRequired`) and the
 *    only correct response is to discard local state for that calendar and
 *    resync in full.
 *
 * 6. Refresh tokens die on: user revocation, SIX MONTHS of non-use, a password
 *    change when Gmail scopes are attached, exceeding the live-token cap, and
 *    admin policy. Separately, an OAuth app left in TESTING publishing status
 *    is issued refresh tokens that expire after SEVEN DAYS. That last one is
 *    the failure mode this product cannot survive quietly: the brain stops
 *    updating about a week after handoff and looks like it broke on its own.
 *    `invalid_grant` therefore raises an error that names the cause and the
 *    fix rather than a bare HTTP status.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY singleEvents IS FALSE BY DEFAULT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * singleEvents=true expands a recurring event into one resource per instance.
 * For a calendar UI that is correct. For a retrieval brain it is actively
 * harmful, for three reasons:
 *
 *   a. Vector duplication. A weekly standup over two years becomes 104
 *      near-identical documents whose embeddings are nearly the same vector.
 *      Any query touching standups fills its top 5 with copies of one meeting
 *      and crowds out the one-off that actually answers the question. The
 *      product is sold on retrieval honesty, so this is a correctness issue
 *      wearing a performance costume.
 *
 *   b. No window to bound the expansion. timeMin and timeMax are forbidden
 *      alongside syncToken (see 3), so on every incremental sync there is no
 *      way to cap how far an unbounded "repeats forever" series expands.
 *
 *   c. Cost. Every instance is an embedding call and a stored row, paid by the
 *      client, for information that is by definition identical.
 *
 * With singleEvents=false the API still returns modified and cancelled
 * INSTANCES as their own resources carrying recurringEventId, so the
 * occurrences that genuinely differ are captured individually. The occurrences
 * that do not differ are exactly the ones that carry no new information.
 *
 * The cost of this choice is real and is paid in the renderer: a series master
 * carries only its first occurrence date, so "who did I meet about Henderson
 * in June" against a weekly Henderson series has to reason from the recurrence
 * rather than match a June date. `describeRecurrence` therefore renders the
 * RRULE into plain English with its span ("repeats weekly on Tuesday, from 7
 * April 2026 until 25 August 2026") so the span is in the embedded text rather
 * than locked inside an RRULE string that embeds as noise.
 *
 * Set singleEvents:true in config for a client who truly needs per-instance
 * records. It is supported, it is fingerprinted, and it will force a resync.

 *      install while the connector reported success. Found by running a
 *      rendered document through worker/src/lib/secret-scan.js rather than by
