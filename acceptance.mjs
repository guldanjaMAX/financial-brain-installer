/**
 * acceptance — prove a live brain install actually works.
 *
 * Run against ANY install, at any time, by anyone holding the admin key:
 *
 *   brain test <manifest>
 *
 * This is deliberately two things at once.
 *
 * As a TEST it is the gate on an install and on every upgrade: it is what
 * turns "deployed" into "working", and an upgrade that has not passed it is a
 * belief rather than a release.
 *
 * As a PRODUCT FEATURE it is the artifact a client can run themselves, on
 * their own infrastructure, without asking us anything. That matters more than
 * it sounds: the whole promise is that they own this. An install they cannot
 * independently verify is one they have to trust us about, which is exactly
 * the dependency the custody model exists to remove.
 *
 * TIERS, in dependency order. A failure in an early tier makes later tiers
 * meaningless, so the run reports which tier broke rather than dumping a wall
 * of consequential failures.
 *
 *   1 reach      is it up, is auth enforced
 *   2 data       is anything in it, and is EVERY source that should be
 *                refreshing still refreshing
 *   3 retrieval  does a real question return real sources
 *   4 safety     does the credential gate actually refuse
 *   5 operations schema version, migrations, spend cap
 *
 * Every check is READ-ONLY except the credential-gate probe, which attempts an
 * ingest that MUST be refused. If that probe ever succeeds, the test fails
 * loudly and the content it wrote is reported for removal.
