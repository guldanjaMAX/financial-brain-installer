// ocr.js — read one page of a scanned document, inside the client's own account.
//
// WHY THIS IS A WORKER ROUTE AND NOT A CALL FROM THE INSTALLER
//
// The installer could reach Cloudflare's REST API directly with an account
// token and get the same model. It must not, for three reasons that all point
// the same way.
//
// The spend cap lives here. `callLLM` refuses once the day's budget is gone,
// logs every call, and degrades rather than failing open. A CLI-side REST call
// would walk straight past all of it, on the client's own payment method, one
// page at a time. OCR is the first bulk, automatic, per-document inference cost
// this product has ever had; it is exactly the thing the cap was built for.
//
// The credential is already right. The installer holds the brain admin key. A
// direct REST path would mean a standing Cloudflare control-plane token present
// during routine ingest, which this product deliberately moved away from:
// ingest is a data-plane operation.
//
// And the binding is already there. Every install declares `[ai] binding =
// "AI"`, so the model runs in the client's account with no new resource, no new
// account, and nothing to revoke at handoff.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
//
// It does not use `env.AI.toMarkdown()`. That helper accepts PDFs and looks
// like the obvious answer, and it is the trap. Cloudflare's own description of
// its PDF path is metadata plus structure plus "extract the text of the page
// as-is" — no rasterisation and no vision model, which is precisely nothing on
// a page that has no text. Its IMAGE path is worse for this purpose: it runs a
// captioning prompt and returns a DESCRIPTION of the picture. A statement page
// through that comes back as prose about a document rather than the document,
// and indexing that as content is the fabrication this whole product exists to
// refuse.
