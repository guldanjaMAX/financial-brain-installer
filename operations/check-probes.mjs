/**
 * The facts worth asking a corpus about, because they CHANGE.
 *
 * A probe is a retrieval query plus a way to pull candidate values out of the
 * text that comes back. Everything here is generic: no client's details appear
 * in this file, and none should. A brain that knows nothing about insurance
 * simply reports that category as absent, which is itself worth knowing.
 *
 * Extraction is deliberately regex, not a model. A sweep that costs money is a
 * sweep nobody runs twice, and these categories have shapes. Where a category
 * has no reliable shape (who is a client, which accountant), `freeform: true`
 * says so and the owner reads the records themselves rather than being shown
 * a machine's guess at a value.
