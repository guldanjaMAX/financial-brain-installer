-- 0018_bank_feed — connector state for the hosted read-only bank feed.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE MIGRATION FROM THE LEDGER
--
-- 0017 holds financial FACTS. This file holds the plumbing that fetches them:
-- which banks the owner connected, where each connection has read up to, and
-- the encrypted reference that lets the worker ask for more. None of that is a
-- financial fact and none of it belongs in `fin_*`.
--
-- The separation is not tidiness. `fin_*` is exported by the recovery adapter,
-- read by the answer path, and mirrored into snapshots. A credential in there
-- would ride along with all three. Keeping the two apart means a table dump of
-- the ledger cannot leak a bank connection, and it means the ledger stays
-- provider-agnostic: the same rows arrive from a downloaded OFX file and from
-- this feed, and nothing downstream can tell or needs to.
--
-- WHAT THE OWNER ACTUALLY AUTHORISES
--
-- The account holder completes the authorisation themselves, in their own
-- browser, on their own bank's website or the aggregator's hosted screen. No
-- password, no one-time code, and no bank credential is ever seen, handled,
-- requested, or stored by the operator, by this worker, or by anyone else. What
-- comes back is a read-only reference for fetching transaction history, and it
-- lives here, in the client's own database, inside the client's own account.
--
-- The reference is stored ENCRYPTED (AES-GCM, key derived from a worker secret
-- the database does not contain). A D1 export, a backup, or a careless admin
-- route therefore cannot hand anyone a working bank connection. The CHECK on
-- `access_ciphertext` is a structural guard on that promise: ciphertext is
-- base64 and base64 has no hyphen, so a value carrying one is a plaintext
-- reference and the database refuses it outright.
--
-- Every statement is independently idempotent: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS and
-- CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS only, no ALTER, no triggers. D1's REST endpoint
-- commits per statement, so a crash mid-file must leave a resumable schema.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ items --
