/**
 * WhatsApp live capture, Node half — drain the capture daemon's local outbox
 * into the brain, and drive the pairing that creates it.
 *
 * THE SPLIT, AND WHY IT IS THIS WAY. `daemons/whatsapp/` is a small Go binary
 * that holds the WhatsApp websocket open and writes one row per message into a
 * local SQLite outbox. It sessionizes nothing, batches nothing, and speaks no
 * HTTP. Everything above that line lives here, in the same JavaScript every
 * other message source already uses: `ingest/message-session.mjs` groups the
 * stream into bounded conversation documents and the shared batch push carries
 * them to the client's own worker, credential gate included. One
 * implementation of the grouping rules, in one language, is the whole point —
 * a second copy in Go would drift the first time the session defaults change.
 *
 * THE FOUR INVARIANTS THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP TRUE
 *
 * 1. IDEMPOTENT ON MESSAGE IDENTITY. The daemon's outbox is already unique on
 *    (chat_jid, message_id), so a message delivered twice (reconnect replay, or
 *    once live and again inside a history-sync chunk) is one row. That row's
 *    id becomes part of the session document's source_id, so re-sending a page
 *    produces byte-identical documents the worker acknowledges as "unchanged".
 *    Re-running is therefore always safe.
 *
 * 2. THE CURSOR ONLY ADVANCES PAST DURABLE WORK. State carries BOTH the
 *    highest outbox `seq` consumed AND the sessionizer's open-session snapshot,
 *    written atomically together (tmp + rename, owner-only), and only after the
 *    page's closed documents were acknowledged. A kill at any point replays at
 *    most one page into the previous snapshot: same sessions again, never a
 *    split conversation and never a gap.
 *
 * 3. `drained_at` IS TELEMETRY, THE CURSOR IS TRUTH. The drain stamps
 *    `drained_at` on everything at or below the cursor so the daemon's own
 *    "N undrained" line stays honest, but it never reads that column to decide
 *    what to send. The stamp is a best-effort write into a database another
 *    process owns; if it is busy, read-only, or interrupted, the next drain
 *    stamps the same range again (`WHERE seq <= cursor AND drained_at IS NULL`)
 *    and nothing is lost either way.
 *
 * 4. ARRIVAL ORDER IS NOT TIME ORDER, AND THAT IS HANDLED, NOT IGNORED.
 *    chat.db hands the iMessage connector rows in ROWID order, which is also
 *    chronological. WhatsApp does not: history-sync chunks land on concurrent
 *    goroutines, so an older message can carry a higher `seq` than a newer one.
 *    Each page is therefore sorted by (ts, seq) before it reaches the
 *    sessionizer, which documents itself as consuming a chronological stream.
 *    Across a page boundary the guarantee is weaker and is reported rather than
 *    hidden: `rows_out_of_order` counts rows older than the previous page's
 *    newest, and the only consequence is that one conversation-day may be
 *    represented by two documents instead of one. No message is dropped and
 *    none is duplicated.
 *
 * TERMS OF SERVICE. Pairing joins the owner's WhatsApp account as a linked
 * device through a reimplementation of the multi-device protocol, not an
 * official API. WhatsApp treats unofficial clients as a Terms of Service
 * violation that can lead to an account restriction or ban. The connector
 * ships behind an explicit opt-in for exactly that reason. The
 * disclosure below is the product's voice on it and is printed before anything
 * is paired.
