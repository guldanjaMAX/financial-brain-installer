/**
 * Tests for the HTML verification report.
 *
 * The report is the one artifact that leaves our hands and lives in the
 * client's, so the properties tested here are the ones that would be
 * embarrassing or dangerous to get wrong in a file we cannot recall:
 *
 *   it renders untrusted document content as text, never as markup
 *   it never carries a credential out of the install and into a file
 *   it never depends on anything it would have to fetch
 *   it says "failing" when something is failing
 *   it degrades into a useful document when the interesting data is missing
 *
 * The last block runs the real Acceptance class against a stubbed fetch, so
 * the input shape here is the shape acceptance.mjs actually produces rather
 * than the shape this renderer wishes it produced.
 *
 * Run: node test/report-html.test.mjs
