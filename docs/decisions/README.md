# Architecture decision records

Use an ADR for a choice that changes system structure, a key quality attribute,
an ownership boundary, or something expensive to reverse. Accepted records are
append-only. When a decision changes, add a new record with `Supersedes` and
update the old record's status to `Superseded` without rewriting its rationale.

Start from `000-template.md`. Keep each record short enough to review with the
code it governs.
