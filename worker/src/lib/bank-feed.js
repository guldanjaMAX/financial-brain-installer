/**
 * bank-feed — a hosted, read-only bank connection, running inside the CLIENT's
 * own worker and writing into the client's own ledger.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, IN THE OWNER'S WORDS
 *
 * The account holder connects their own bank, themselves, in their own browser.
 * The bank login happens on the bank's own site or on the aggregator's hosted
 * screen. No password, no one-time code, no security question and no bank
 * credential of any kind is ever seen, requested, handled or stored by the
 * operator, by this code, or by anyone but the account holder and their bank.
 * What comes back is a read-only reference for FETCHING transaction history. It
 * cannot move money, and it lives encrypted in the client's own database inside
 * the client's own cloud account.
 *
 * The read-only guarantee is not enforced by this code being careful. It is
 * enforced at authorisation time by never requesting a product that can move
 * money — see `REQUESTED_PRODUCTS` and `FORBIDDEN_PRODUCTS`, which a test
 * asserts against literally so a future "just add one more scope" cannot land
 * unreviewed.
 *
 * WHY EVERY IDENTIFIER COMES FROM `env`
 *
 * The two service identifiers are read from the environment, never from a
 * module constant, and the aggregator's own hostname with them. That is what
 * keeps the deployment model reversible: per-client credentials (recommended:
 * one client's blast radius is one client) and a shared operator account differ
 * only in what values are set, not in what code runs. The tenant reference is
 * confined to `tenantReference()` for the same reason — under per-client it is
 * cosmetic, under shared it is load-bearing, and there is exactly one place to
 * change it.
 *
 * THE SIGN CONVENTION — read this before touching an amount.
 *
 * This provider reports a POSITIVE number when money LEAVES the account, and a
 * negative one when money arrives. That is the opposite of a downloaded OFX
 * file, where a negative amount is money leaving. Both are normalised at the
 * one write boundary (`fin-import.js`) into an unsigned amount plus an explicit
 * direction, and the signed source figure travels with it. Getting this
 * backwards turns income into spending and a profit into a loss while every
 * citation still resolves, which is the most expensive mistake available here.
