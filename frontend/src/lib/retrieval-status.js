/**
 * retrieval-status — what an empty result set is allowed to mean.
 *
 * Retrieval can return nothing for two completely different reasons, and until
 * this module existed both produced the same sentence:
 *
 *   1. The corpus genuinely holds nothing on the question. Saying so plainly is
 *      the product working. That path is untouched here.
 *   2. Part of the search never ran. The vector index is still building right
 *      after an install, the embedding model did not answer, keyword search is
 *      down. Nothing is known about the corpus, because the corpus was not
 *      fully read.
 *
 * Case 2 wearing case 1's sentence is the worst error this product can make: a
 * confident absence claim about the owner's own records, produced by the exact
 * discipline the brain is built on, and indistinguishable to the reader from a
 * correct answer. It is at its most likely on install day, when the index is
 * still projecting and the owner is asking their first questions.
 *
 * So the two cases get different statuses, different gap types, and different
 * sentences, and every surface derives them from here rather than writing its
 * own. `degraded` is the signal that separates them; it has ridden the wire
 * since before this module, which is why the clients can defend themselves with
 * `retrievalUnavailable` even against a worker deployed before this change.
