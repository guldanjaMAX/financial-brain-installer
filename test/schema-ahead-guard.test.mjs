/**
 * A brain whose schema is ahead of every migration in the release has run code
 * this release has never seen. The version guard cannot catch it: it compares
 * recorded product-version STRINGS, and a brain built from a working branch can
 * record a lower string while running a higher schema. The maintainer's own brain on
 * 2026-09-03 recorded product_version 0.1.16 with schema_version 32 while the
 * release shipped 22 migrations, so the update would have read it as an upgrade
 * and renumbered a schema with no clean repair.
