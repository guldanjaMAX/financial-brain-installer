# Architecture

`brain-installer` is one shared installer that creates many isolated brains.
The product code stays the same. Each install differs through its manifest,
source selections, credentials, local resume state, and resources inside the
owner's Cloudflare account.

## Deployment model

```text
Source systems and local files
           |
           | local extraction, quality checks, credential refusal
           v
brain CLI on the owner's machine
           |
           | HTTPS with this brain's admin key
           v
Cloudflare Worker in the owner's account
      |                         |
      | durable text/metadata  | derived semantic vectors
      v                         v
     D1  ---- vector outbox -> Vectorize
      |
      +---- FTS5 keyword index
```

Normal owner setup and updates use a per-install named Cloudflare browser
profile in the operating-system credential store for control-plane work such as
verification, provisioning, deployment, migration, and Worker secrets. Scoped
API tokens are limited to explicit automation, recovery, and older manifests.
Routine use goes through the deployed Worker with the Brain's own admin key.
Removing the control-plane profile or revoking a recovery token does not disable
retrieval, health, ingest through a configured domain, evaluation, drain, or
reindex.

The standard backend is D1 plus Vectorize. Legacy Supabase adapters and
migration tools remain so an existing corpus can be moved or temporarily
compared, but they are not a separate product tier and are never selected from
corpus size alone.

### Shared product versus one install

| Shared installer | Per-install instance |
|---|---|
| CLI, Worker, migrations, connectors, tests | Manifest and Cloudflare resource IDs |
| Manifest schema and public template | D1 database, Vectorize index, Worker, routes |
| Extraction, safety, retrieval, and evaluation logic | Source policy and resumable ingest state |
| Public docs and onboarding | Durable admin key and Google OAuth record |
| Blank eval template | Private golden questions, baselines, reports, receipts |

Instance material never belongs in the published package. A manifest is not a
secret, but it can still identify an owner and infrastructure, so it receives
the same packaging caution as private evaluation data.

## Code map

| Area | Primary files | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| CLI lifecycle | `brain.mjs`, `doctor.mjs` | Dispatch, setup, control-plane calls, command UX, health, ingest orchestration |
| Worker data plane | `worker/src/index.js` | Authenticated routes, retrieval, answer generation, admin operations, scheduled drain |
| Storage | `worker/src/lib/store.js`, `store-d1.js`, `supabase.js` | Backend selection, D1 and legacy storage behavior, vector outbox, source lifecycle |
| D1 schema | `migrations/d1/` | Append-only schema and data migrations |
| Extraction | `ingest/` | File walking, format extraction, quality checks, dates, splitting, batching, resume state |
| Google sources | `connectors/google-auth.mjs`, `google-drive.mjs`, `gmail.mjs`, `google-calendar.mjs` | OAuth storage and source-specific listing, cursor, export, and envelope logic |
| Local operations | `operations/` | Admin-key persistence, Claude owner-workspace guidance, and macOS unattended scheduling (Drive, iMessage capture, watched folder) |
| MCP | `components/brain-mcp.mjs`, `brain-mcp-runtime.mjs` | Tool surface and runtime resolution of the current durable admin key |
| Acceptance and eval | `acceptance.mjs`, `eval/`, `report*.mjs` | Install checks, retrieval measurement, regression comparison, owner-facing reports |
| Migration | `migration/` | One-time Supabase corpus and message-session import |
| Support evidence | `support-journal.mjs` and CLI failure handling | Privacy-safe local issue classification, retention, preview, and export |
| Product contract | `manifest.schema.json`, `templates/`, `README.md`, `docs/`, `onboarding/` | Configuration shape, current capability claims, and operating instructions |

`brain.mjs` is currently large and contains several command domains. New work
should move toward focused command modules with explicit arguments and injected
dependencies. Preserve behavior with characterization tests before extracting a
live path.

## Install and upgrade lifecycle

`brain setup` is intentionally ordered:

1. Run local preflight checks, including a signed-in Claude Code CLI for an
   owner-machine install and pinned Wrangler 4. A deliberate `--no-connect`
   technician-machine install keeps Claude advisory on that machine.
2. Create or resume the manifest, declare durable admin-key storage, and
   prepare the exact desired key before remote changes.
3. Verify the selected Cloudflare approval and exact account. Because the
   narrow session cannot read billing, open that account's plan page and bind
   the separate owner Workers Paid confirmation to it before provisioning D1 or
   Vectorize. The same account-bound prerequisite applies to resumed, recovery,
   and automation setup paths. A new install with no existing Worker can migrate
   and deploy directly. A resumed D1 install with an existing Worker first
   captures a required bookmark, deploys and verifies the paused compatibility
   Worker, waits the declared 20-minute old-invocation window, migrates, and
   deploys active mode.
4. Persist and read back the admin key, set Worker secrets, and verify health.
5. Register locator-only MCP entries for supported AI tools with the local-only
   `owner-assistant` profile, then verify the advertised tool list includes
   curated write and diagnostics. When Claude Code is connected, write an
   owner-only `CLAUDE.md` beside the manifest with exact locators and safe
   approved-folder rules. Preserve an unrelated existing file.
6. Optionally ingest the first folder and report the vector backlog.

Deploy must happen before Worker secrets because Cloudflare attaches secrets to
an existing script. Health after deploy must observe the expected package
version, not merely any HTTP 200, because the previous Worker can remain visible
briefly during propagation.

Provisioning adopts only resources whose identity and stored install state prove
they belong to this client. Migrations are checksum-protected, append-only, and
restart-safe after every independently committed statement. A D1 upgrade
captures a required bookmark, deploys and verifies the paused compatibility
Worker, waits the same old-invocation window, migrates, deploys active mode,
reconciles allowed provider secrets, waits for the new version, and records
success. Schema 13 changes that ordering only for an existing legacy
projection: after migration, the verified write barrier stays active while the
Worker rebuilds durable 1,000-row batches. A bounded number of disjoint provider
mutations may be accepted concurrently. Every row carries its D1 generation,
and exact `getByIds` readback must match that generation before the batch
receipt can be cleared. Only a fully verified projection permits the active
deployment. Direct `brain migrate` refuses a live D1 install that needs the writer
protocol migrations because it cannot prove that older Worker invocations are
quiescent. Rollback is explicit and does not pretend Vectorize is
transactionally restored with D1. It leaves the Worker paused until supervised
recovery recreates/rebinds a clean Vectorize index, because reindex cannot
enumerate provider-only post-bookmark ids.

Verified recovery keeps orchestration provider-neutral and places all live
Cloudflare access behind a separate disposable-only adapter. The adapter binds
reviewed manifests to exact D1, Vectorize, Worker deployment, runtime values,
and secret names before either source export or target access. Its target
execution approval also binds the immutable Worker version and a manually
reviewed empty route/custom-domain claim. A separate approval binds the exact
private release golden SHA-256 across every supervised stop and resume. D1
remains the durable authority. FTS and Vectorize are rebuilt derived state.
Recovery control files contain
fingerprints and bounded evidence only; the owner-only SQL export is the sole
recovery artifact that contains corpus data. The Vectorize drain owner and
expiry are invocation-local coordination, not recoverable state. Recovery
therefore excludes `install_state` from the raw provider export, recreates its
reviewed singleton row with lease and mutation fields forced to SQL `NULL`, a
corpus-derived bootstrap status/epoch, and the exact `MAX(chunk_uid)` high-water,
then resets the derived outbox generation and bulk-bootstrap base to zero,
forces the bootstrap protocol to `NULL`, and excludes provider-specific queue
and batch receipts before hashing the remaining durable data.
Exact older migration prefixes remain inspectable by the offline verifier only.
The live field recovery runner requires this package's exact current migration
prefix on both source and restored target before it can export, promote the
current Worker, or invoke the current drain protocol.

## Ingest lifecycle

All producers converge on the same document envelope and batch write path:

```text
list or walk
  -> enforce private paths and source exclusions
  -> extract text
  -> judge format and content quality
  -> scan the complete logical document for credential-like material
  -> split oversized content into one document family
  -> send bounded authenticated batches
  -> validate every per-document receipt
  -> save accepted, skipped, refused, failed, and removal state
  -> advance a remote cursor only after the run is complete
```

Local OCR planning stops before the mutating half of this lifecycle. `brain
ocr-preflight <manifest> --path <folder> --json` runs the same link-refusing
walker and PDF extraction boundary with an explicit null OCR callback. The PDF
extractor's closed observation now survives `extract()` and `prepare()` even
when a scan is refused for having no text layer, preserving its authoritative
page count without parsing human error prose. The operation module receives
only these content-free observations and produces an exact aggregate schema.
It reports known scan-only documents/pages, per-document-cap eligibility,
cost/time ranges for the exact reviewed default model, the manifest cap, the
estimated full-cap comparison, and typed uninspectable cases. A nondefault model
or pricing-contract mismatch is unpriced rather than estimated at the default
model's rate. Remaining shared daily budget and actual affordability are unknown
because this local command deliberately does not ask the Brain for today's model
spend. Traversal gaps cannot read as zero, and adjudicated source-policy or
external-junction subtrees do not read as in-scope gaps.

The command is outside the process-wide Wrangler credential session and never
loads the admin key, source state, checkpoints, or cursors. It has no OCR,
application HTTP, application key-store, receipt, or application-controlled
write call. Reading a cloud-synced local file may cause its operating-system file
provider to hydrate it. Provider network, credential, and filesystem effects are
therefore explicit unknowns. A state-bound SHA-256 fingerprint commits to the
private root identity, PDF byte receipts, exact OCR model, versioned pricing
basis, policy, observations, and skip set; only that fingerprint and aggregates
leave the boundary. It is groundwork for a later approval flow, not
authorization to perform OCR.

`ingest/outcome.mjs` is the shared source-level result contract. Only
`completed` is success-shaped. `partial`, `unavailable`, `retryable`, and
`refused` carry distinct flags, and a dry run carries no ingestion outcome.
`test/ingestion-contract.test.mjs` applies that contract across folders,
Calendar, message capture, source planning, cursor settlement, document
families, and deletion planning. It is an automated conformance gate, not a
real-source acceptance receipt. `brain load` prints the full sweep first, then
returns non-zero when any enabled source is unavailable, retryable, refused, or
partial; disabled and push-only sources remain explicit non-error skips.
The iMessage, WhatsApp, and iPhone-backup command adapters report submitted,
accepted, and refused conversation counts separately. A refused conversation
therefore makes the sweep partial instead of being counted as present. Their
dry runs count the conversation documents they would submit while sending no
request and writing no resume state. An explicit `--limit` is also partial,
whether or not the current source had more records beyond the bound. Refusal
receipts keep a redacted reason for audit without storing the refused content.

Local and remote state is saved adjacent to the manifest as
`.brain-ingest-<source>.json`. Content hashes and source versions make reruns
resumable. A failure stays retryable. Drive policy changes and periodic full
sweeps compare source truth with stored families so excluded, deleted, moved,
or no-longer-accessible files can be removed safely.

Mutating local-folder, Drive, Gmail, and Calendar runs share one cross-platform
owner lease keyed to the canonical adjacent source-state path. The lease is
acquired before credential or network access, checked before every document or
batch send and before each OCR, removal, state, and source-receipt mutation,
and released in `finally`.
Direct commands, scheduled children, and `brain load` enter the same writer
boundary exactly once. Legacy provenance repair apply is disabled before this
boundary; any future repair executor must enter it. Its private owner token and heartbeat
allow a stale dead process to be recovered without letting an old timestamp
evict a live long-running sync. Dry runs do not take the lease because they
write no state or source receipt.
Manifest-file symlinks resolve to the target before the state identity is
derived. A multiply hard-linked manifest is rejected before the runtime lock,
credentials, or network because it has no portable single adjacent state path.
Google source writers acquire that source lease first and then one shared
`provider:google` lease before opening the credential record. The Google OAuth
connect ceremony uses the same shared lease. Mutating load preflight reads only
credential-store metadata; dry-run connectors use a full-record reader that
cannot migrate legacy Windows or macOS storage.

The authenticated HTTP batch route preserves one receipt per input document.
For D1 it reads prior rows for unique document identities in one batch preflight,
so an unchanged 50-document safety rescan is one database round trip rather than
50 sequential reads. Each changed attempt owns a revision-unique pending marker.
When one document's complete stage fits our conservative 100-statement
transaction slice, its document row, old-vector queue, chunk replacement, and
new outbox rows commit in one
document-isolated transaction. Documents are deliberately not combined, so one
bad row cannot roll back a neighbor. A larger document retains the resumable
multi-call stage, slices derived writes to the same internal bound, and
keeps its pending-marker recovery path.

Binding round trips and paid D1 queries are different units. The normal maximum
50-document, one-chunk message request uses 53 binding round trips but submits
352 SQL statements. Before its first D1 read, the Worker reserves a deliberately
pessimistic statement cost for every eligible document and refuses a request
above 900 statements, leaving margin below Cloudflare's 1,000-query invocation
ceiling. A byte-valid request can therefore still receive a pre-write 413 with
guidance to send fewer or smaller documents; it never discovers that ceiling
after creating partial pending revisions.

Every chunk delete, chunk write, outbox write, and final commit is conditional
on still owning the exact marker. The compare-and-swap and one derived
statistics refresh commit together per touched source, followed by exact
readback. The refresh derives freshness only from markers that still belong to
that transaction, so an all-stale finalizer leaves counts and `last_ingest_at`
unchanged. The same atomic rule covers ordinary one-document ingest. A final
content hash by itself is not proof because same-content revisions can carry
different metadata. Repeated identities in one request deliberately use the
original sequential path because revision order is part of their correctness
contract.

Drive and watched-folder removal candidates from policy, source deletion, and
intentional quality skips are intersected with the current authenticated
stored-family inventory and approved as one deterministic plan. Stored-family
inventory derives declared `family_of` relationships as well as structural
`part_of` families, even when a message row belongs to an upload file's family.
After a deletion receipt, the client reads that inventory again and refuses to
record completion while any exact target remains. Crossing either the
100-document limit or the 10% stored-corpus limit stops before planned deletion
and cursor or source-state completion. Approval binds to an opaque fingerprint
of the exact categorized target set, so a changed plan requires a new decision
without exposing source identifiers.

### Connector status

| Source | Current path |
|---|---|
| Local folders, including an Obsidian vault | Built through `--path`; Obsidian is file ingest, not a separate connector |
| Google Drive | Built, resumable, incremental, deletion-aware, and schedulable on macOS |
| Gmail | Built with cursor safety; full real-account production validation remains a field gate |
| Google Calendar | Built and wired through `brain ingest --from calendar`; row and receipt namespaces match, and event failure, refusal, or pending cancellation cleanup withholds the Google sync token; real-account validation remains a field gate |
| Local watched folder | Built through the ordinary resumable folder ingest path and schedulable on macOS; multi-cycle field proof remains open |
| iMessage | Built for incremental local capture on macOS; real-user database and long-lived scheduler proof remain field gates |
| WhatsApp | Safe per-chat export ingest is built. Unofficial paired-device live capture is opt-in, violates WhatsApp's Terms of Service, and is not real-account proven. Meta's official WhatsApp Business Platform connector is not built. |
| SMS and Google Voice exports | Built as sessionized file imports; real export samples remain acceptance gates |
| iPhone backup | Built against a synthetic unencrypted backup; an Apple-written backup remains a field gate |
| Zoom | Built as a transcript webhook; a paid real-account meeting remains a field gate |
| Bank exports and hosted feed | Built into the shared financial ledger; real-statement and real-feed reconciliation remain field gates |
| OCR for scanned PDFs | Built, optional, and provenance-marked; aggregate local preflight is read-only and synthetic-tested, while private real scans remain a field gate |
| Slack and Notion | Built behind field gates with scripted provider-I/O proof; no real workspace has completed acceptance |
| Microsoft 365 and Dropbox | Built behind field gates for mail and files, cursor resume, tombstones, and scheduling; no real tenant or account has completed acceptance |
| QuickBooks Online and HubSpot CRM | Built behind field gates with owner connection, incremental read, retry, and disconnect paths; no provider sandbox or real account has completed acceptance |
| Plaid | Native owner connection, incremental read, signed webhook, scheduled reconciliation, retry, repair, and disconnect paths are built, but general bank invitations and application-credential setup are held. Generic setup preserves a complete, already approved Worker binding set and refuses a missing or partial set before mutation. `brain connect bank` is a field-plan entrypoint until disposable-candidate acceptance and a separately approved production pilot pass |
| Box and Airtable | No native API connector. Box can use a reviewed export or locally synced watched folder. Airtable requires an approved export until a native connector is built. |

The macOS Drive scheduler installs a per-user LaunchAgent. Its definition has no
credentials. It resolves the declared durable admin key at runtime, uses Google
OAuth from its chosen store, takes an owner-only lock, and rotates owner-only
logs after the lock-holding ingest exits. The iMessage capture lane and the
watched local folder lane are the same machinery with a different connector
spec, so all three share that hardening rather than each re-deriving it.
Windows and Linux do not yet have an equivalent unattended source scheduler.

## D1, FTS5, Vectorize, and the outbox

D1 is authoritative for documents, chunks, source metadata, freshness,
migration state, and operations history. FTS5 is maintained from D1 chunk rows
and provides keyword candidates.

Vectorize is a derived index. There is no transaction spanning D1 and
Vectorize, so ingest does not claim semantic completion at the moment a chunk is
written. The same D1 transaction that stores chunk state queues a vector-outbox
operation. The Worker's cron, or `brain drain`, embeds queued text with the
declared Cloudflare Workers AI model and applies vector upserts or deletes.
Failed work remains queued.

`queued_at` measures backlog age and may legitimately repeat within one
millisecond. It is not a revision identity. D1 assigns every enqueue a strictly
increasing `generation` from the durable install-state clock. Drain cleanup and
failure bookkeeping compare that generation, operation, and vector identity,
so a drain holding an older snapshot cannot clear or mutate a newly requeued
row even when both rows share the same timestamp.

Vectorize itself has no conditional write, so generation-CAS alone cannot make
two simultaneous drains safe: an older invocation could land last after a newer
one. Every manual or scheduled drain therefore claims one opaque, expiring D1
lease for its complete bounded invocation. A second drain receives a busy
response without reading or exposing the owner token and performs no embedding,
Vectorize write, or outbox acknowledgement. Normal completion and exceptions
release only the matching owner; an abruptly terminated Worker recovers when
the bounded lease expires.

The source-forget path is enqueue-only: it deletes authoritative D1 content and
queues vector deletes, but never writes Vectorize directly. This makes the
leased drain the only Vectorize writer. Each drain also maintains a conservative
900-query internal budget, including lease operations, worst-case hashed-ID
remaps, cleanup, failure bookkeeping, and final depth. `maxBatches` is a latency
preference, not permission to cross that budget; a drain stops cleanly with
remaining work queued and always reserves its lease-release query.

Vectorize V2 accepts a mutation before that mutation is query-visible. A drain
therefore has two durable phases. First it records the provider mutation ID on
the exact outbox generation and on the singleton projection fence, leaving the
row queued. A later leased drain waits for the provider's processed watermark,
then uses `getByIds` to prove the exact generation for an upsert or exact absence
for a delete. Only that confirmation deletes the outbox row. A processed receipt
whose vector is missing or stale is requeued with an explicit failure instead
of being counted as embedded.

Readiness is similarly exact: D1 chunk count, outbox depth, submitted depth,
the provider watermark, and Vectorize count must all agree. The documents
inventory exposes this as `vector_readiness`; `brain health`, `brain test`, the
message-migration completion receipt, and every semantic answer fail or mark
degradation until it is true. This prevents a non-empty but partially updated
Vectorize result page from looking like complete semantic retrieval.

This creates a deliberate temporary state:

- keyword search can find a new chunk immediately;
- semantic search cannot find it until its outbox entry is visibility-confirmed;
- the public `/health` route remains a reach/version probe, not a corpus claim;
- `brain health`, `brain test`, message replay, retrieval responses, and backlog
  reporting require or disclose exact projection readiness.

`brain reindex` rebuilds missing/current Vectorize entries from D1 when metadata
indexes or drift make the derived index untrustworthy. It cannot remove unknown
provider-only ids, so rollback/excess recovery first requires a clean supervised
index replacement and rebind. Reindex does not need the original source files.
Ordinary whole-corpus reindex records one durable epoch and advances in
conservative 99-chunk pages while the Brain remains active. A lifecycle upgrade
has a stronger write barrier and a different scale profile: schema 13 tags
durable 1,000-row batches, permits only disjoint batches in its bounded
in-flight window, and confirms the exact generation of every vector before
advancing the verified receipt. Re-running either path resumes its D1 cursor
and provider receipts instead of resetting completed pages.

## Retrieval and answer flow

For a query, the Worker builds two independent candidate sets: semantic matches
from Vectorize and keyword matches from D1 FTS5. Metadata filters are applied as
early as the backend supports. Reciprocal rank fusion combines the rankings.
Optional reranking may reorder a bounded candidate set when explicitly enabled.
Scaffolding files are demoted rather than silently removed.

Retrieval first collapses multiple chunks from one document. It also collapses
same-source, same-date documents with the same canonical content hash before the
public result limit, so copied files cannot occupy several evidence slots. The
source and date remain part of the key because identical text can be a valid
record at a different time or in a different connector. The internal content
hash is removed from the response. This is retrieval protection, not physical
deduplication: source lifecycle rows remain intact until an alias-aware storage
plan can preserve update and deletion semantics.

Evidence independence uses a separate metadata contract. A producer that knows
the origin of a document may set `metadata.evidence_lineage` to version 1 with
kind `source_record`, `derived_record`, or `agent_derived`. A derived record must
name every durable source-family id in `root_ids`. A source record may omit
`root_ids`, in which case its own fully qualified document uid is the root.
Malformed contracts are rejected on new ingest. `family_of` still describes a
physical split or import family, but does not by itself prove that the content is
primary evidence.

Retrieval keeps unknown-lineage documents and allows them to support what they
directly say. Their filename cannot promote them to primary or derived authority,
and they earn no independent-corroboration credit. Documents with overlapping
roots form one corroboration group even when one is a generated report and the
other is its ledger. Public results expose only opaque family tokens and a
plain-language lineage status, never the underlying root ids. Agent memory writes
are always stamped `agent_derived` in both metadata and native text so export and
reingest cannot turn an agent's restatement into a new primary source.

`/api/rag/unified` returns ranked evidence. It has no universal relevance floor,
so a result list by itself is not proof that the corpus answers the question.
`/api/rag/think` is the owner-facing answer path: it generates an answer from
retrieved evidence, requires citation discipline for claims, and reports gaps
such as thin coverage, staleness, undated sources, or a single-corpus result.
Every result and citation carries its source identity plus date and extraction
provenance. The owner app, CLI, remote MCP tools, and verification report keep
uncertain dates and OCR warnings beside the citation so stored trust metadata
cannot disappear at the final reading surface.
Ingest accepts `occurred_at` only as `YYYY-MM-DD` or an RFC 3339 instant and
rejects ambiguous or impossible dates before any write. Calendar citations keep
the event's local day, while a persisted RFC 3339 start with an explicit offset
orders events within that day for current or latest questions.
The optional read-only proxy key is accepted only on retrieval routes. The full
admin key protects ingest and operator administration. The app uses passkey
sessions plus the companion app header, and D1 applies exact owned-entity or
exact-document scope before returning evidence.

Coarse capability grants use the registered source's `sources.zone` value as
their authorization authority. The source predicate is part of the D1 query
that reads chunk text, and scoped writes must also name a source inside the
grant's allowed zones. `documents.zone` and `chunks.zone` are derived
projections. Migration 0033 keeps new rows aligned at insert time, while
`brain diagnose` reports legacy projection drift and partial source assignment.
Every `brain zone` assignment repairs up to 1,000 live documents and 1,000
chunks in the same transaction as the source registry update, reports what
remains, and can be repeated until the legacy projections converge. No retrieval
path may trust those projections before that bounded repair completes.
The CLI retries only the field-observed HTML/proxy HTTP 500 for an exact
source-to-zone POST. It repeats the same idempotent assignment at most three
times with 1, 2, and 4 second delays, announces that the prior pass may already
be committed, and preserves the last confirmed checkpoint on exhaustion. It
does not replay JSON 500 responses, other statuses, transport failures, list
requests, or partial assignments.
The exact access-zone readiness audit compares every live document and chunk
with the source registry, so its cost grows with the corpus. It runs only from
the explicit zones and `brain check` path, not from polled health or owner
status. A future routine status surface must use transactionally maintained
aggregate counters rather than moving this scan into its request path.

## Local state and privacy boundaries

Durable secrets never belong in the manifest or MCP registration. The manifest
contains only a non-secret locator when Keychain is used. Standard durable
stores are macOS login Keychain, Windows DPAPI CurrentUser-protected files, and
owner-only Linux files. AI-tool registrations carry the manifest locator plus
the nonsecret local profile and resolve the current key when the MCP process
starts, so rotation does not leave stale copied credentials. The local
`owner-assistant` profile may read, write contract-checked records to the
registered `owner-notes` source, and run diagnostics. That source is
non-refreshable, carries customer-visible MCP provenance, remains unzoned and
excluded from named grants until assigned, and is classified as recollection
rather than authoritative evidence. The owner and an explicitly approved Brain
connector can still use it. A successful response requires exact D1 row and
source readback. A direct write proves that record, not complete conversation history.
It has no delete or access-control tool. Remote OAuth profiles are
a separate list and can never request `owner-assistant`.

The local MCP registration is user-wide, so repository instructions are not an
authorization boundary. `brain_remember` is marked as data-changing and
non-destructive, and the AI client's per-call approval must remain
enabled. The model's tool instructions require a direct current-user request,
but those instructions are defense in depth rather than proof of user presence.

Every shipped client request carrying `X-Admin-Key` requires HTTPS, except for
an explicit loopback test URL, and refuses redirects before sending the header.
The client also rejects a response whose final origin differs from the reviewed
request origin. This is a shared transport invariant because Node preserves
custom headers across a cross-origin redirect even though it strips the standard
`Authorization` header.

The owner-only source inventory is a narrow data-plane exception to the general
admin route gate. `POST /api/admin/brain/sources` accepts the full admin key or
an unscoped owner passkey session, rejects scoped grants, and reads D1 directly.
It never asks for Cloudflare account authority. Default mode returns a complete
or explicitly paged source receipt with masked configuration, physical/logical
storage, readability, freshness, extraction, and lineage evidence. Recovery
mode returns bounded opaque record identities and exact provenance/OCR reason
codes for planning only. Both modes are private, stable-snapshot contracts and
fail on observed corpus drift. Neither inventory mode can write, OCR, reingest,
infer an entity or period, expose a raw locator, or alter the existing MCP tool
set. A source row's `last_failure` is either `null` or the latest Gmail error's
revalidated closed receipt: fixed operation class, HTTP status, canonical
provider reason, aggregate checkpoint counts/readback state, and
cursor-preservation category. Raw provider messages, IDs, paths, cursor values,
content, and secrets never cross this boundary. `/zones` keeps its existing
aggregate semantics and authorization boundary.

The required row key makes this source-inventory contract v3, including both
inventory and recovery cursors. Version mismatch is a refusal, not a partial
parse. A schema-39 database receives one narrowly matched compatibility query
that substitutes `NULL` for the not-yet-created `failure_evidence` column;
other D1 errors cannot enter that fallback.

The legacy CLI `provenance-repair` schema 1 contract is inventory-only. Its
preview still binds one exact source, manifest and source configuration,
semantic inventory and recovery generations, opaque candidate set, machine
readiness, proposed reset/no-limit rewalk mode, and OCR policy. It always
reports `can_apply: false`, because candidate disappearance cannot distinguish
repair from deletion, replacement, refusal, or skip. `--apply` stops before
manifest, credential, network, or source access. Schema-1 readback preserves
every prior candidate as unresolved even when a later inventory no longer
contains it.

Migration 0042 introduces a separate bounded observation ledger for one to ten
explicit local-upload originals. The private admin route accepts raw canonical
source-relative locators only in a JSON request, derives stable HMAC identities
from an independent recoverable D1 key, and never stores or returns those
locators. Seal, inventory, and verify are read-only. Record is append-only,
transactional, bound to one source snapshot and exact target set, and blocked
during an upgrade write pause. Schema 42 records and verifies only gaps,
failures, and adjudicated exclusions.

Migration 0043 adds a revision-scoped raw-original result-binding ledger. The
full-admin-authorized local ingest path hashes the exact bytes used by a
one-record extraction. The Worker derives the schema-42 HMAC identity from the
existing envelope locator and does not copy that locator into the immutable
binding receipt or ledger. Existing document identity fields still retain the
source-relative locator for retrieval and source lifecycle. A changed document
receives a new revision ID. Its final semantic content hash, provenance digest, original hash
and byte count, and deterministic binding hash commit atomically in D1. Full
receipt readback, not pointer presence, is the verification boundary. Exact
replay preserves the revision, while changed raw bytes create a new revision
even when extracted text is identical. Structural parts can share one opaque
original identity; `family_of` exports and legacy content remain unbound. This
proves a full-admin-authorized local ingest assertion, not server-side raw-byte
recomputation, and it does not cryptographically identify the producer binary.
Accepted outcomes remain blocked in both the Worker and the
schema-43 D1 trigger until a separate reviewed change authorizes their use.
Deletion, absence, replacement bytes, an unreadable original, or a changed or
incomplete result family therefore remains unresolved. Every observation
receipt says `whole_source_complete: false`; this contract neither enumerates
a source nor authorizes OCR or ingest.

Migration 0044 adds a two-phase, non-authorizing proof. Each raw-bound chunk
stores a Worker-computed digest over its exact revision ID, chunk index, title,
and stored text after title prefixing. A portable seal then binds the
all-and-only current logical family, with structural parts required to be a
complete contiguous set. The portable tables contain only opaque revision IDs
and hashes, not locators, document IDs, titles, text, queries, or citations.

A second deployment-local seal reads Vectorize before D1, binds the exact
outbox generation and mutation fence, requires target and global outbox zero
and corpus-wide vector-count parity, and runs the production owner retrieval
path twice without reranking. Both ranked results and citations must be
identical, and the top result and citation must resolve to the sealed family.
The final D1 insert rechecks the family and readiness state so a concurrent
corpus mutation fails closed.

Recovery restores portable members before their family header, but excludes
the deployment-local verification because recovery rebuilds Vectorize. A new
verification is required against the recovered projection. Historical headers
use a narrow import marker that can open only before any recovery data exists.
The artifact closes and checks that marker after import, while immutable
schema-43 binding validation remains active throughout. Schema 44 itself
remains non-authorizing. Ordinary observation recording and `result_family`
cannot create an accepted observation; the schema supplies evidence, not
repair authority or whole-source completeness.

Migration 0045 adds a separate accepted-resolution admission protocol on the
full-admin-only `POST /api/admin/brain/source-original-observations` endpoint.
The Worker accepts
`mode: "accepted_resolution"` for exactly one sealed target, with explicit
`record` and read-only `verify` operations. Each operation rebuilds the exact
schema-44 family proof and reruns the deployment-local Vectorize and production
owner retrieval checks. The gate never treats a historical family header or
verification row as proof that the present corpus is unchanged.

Initial admission requires the exact portable family header and members to
have already been written by ordinary `result_family` `record`. That prior
receipt is still non-authorizing; accepted-resolution consumes it but cannot
create it implicitly.

For `record`, the Worker submits the prior unresolved observation, exact raw
hash and byte count, family receipt, fresh verification receipt, and proposed
accepted observation in one D1 batch. An ephemeral admission table and its
triggers recheck the install-state generation and mutation fence, current
bindings, current family and chunk digests, global and target outbox emptiness,
and exact verification hash inside the write transaction. The trigger then
appends the portable resolution, deployment-local activation, and accepted
observation as one atomic admission. Stale proof, concurrent writes, conflicting
replay, or direct accepted-observation insertion fails closed.

The portable resolution records historical acceptance lineage. Currentness is
a separate deployment-local property that requires a matching activation and
verification plus the same live family, queue, generation, mutation, and
projection checks. Recovery exports the portable resolution but excludes
admissions, activations, and result-family verifications. Its import marker
closes only after proving an exact accepted-observation-to-resolution bijection
and empty local acceptance state. The recovered deployment must rerun the
one-target proof and append a fresh local activation before the resolution is
current there.

Migration 0046 closes the remaining cross-machine history race without a
mutable head row. `source_original_observations` adds an immutable chain
version and prior-observation hash. Each normal insert must name the latest
same-original row observed by its reviewed plan, while the first row names
empty history. D1 checks that predecessor inside the insert transaction and a
partial unique index prevents two schema-46 successors from sharing it.
Schema-42 through schema-45 rows remain a version-zero prefix for upgrade and
recovery compatibility. A schema-45 accepted row may resolve an earlier
non-immediate gap because that was legal when it was recorded. Recovery retains
such a row as historical evidence, but it is not current under schema 46 and
cannot be reactivated while its accepted observation fails the current-head and
immediate-predecessor checks.

Accepted admission treats the resolved gap as its predecessor. Exact replay or
recovery reactivation instead requires the accepted observation itself to
remain the current head. The current-acceptance view also requires the accepted
row to be the latest same-original sequence, so a later gap, failure, or
adjudicated exclusion demotes it without deleting evidence. Recovery validates
the immediate-predecessor chain before closing its import marker. Sequence,
not `recorded_at`, is authoritative because different computers do not share a
clock.

The stable `observation_hash` remains an event-receipt digest over the original
schema-42 canonical fields. It is not a self-authenticating chain digest and it
does not cover `predecessor_observation_hash`. Schema 46 binds the chain through
append-only D1 rows, transactional predecessor checks, and recovery-close
validation; authenticated whole-artifact recovery protects those row bytes in
transit and at rest. A future receipt-contract version may include the edge in
its digest without changing the meaning of existing receipts.

This dynamic SQL currentness is scoped to a fixed retrieval contract and
supported Worker, D1, and outbox-mediated mutations. Direct FTS maintenance,
out-of-band Vectorize writes, or a retrieval-code deployment can change ranked
results outside the D1 generation counter. Crossing one of those boundaries
requires rerunning the full accepted-resolution proof before the result is
relied on.

Every accepted-resolution receipt remains
`whole_source_complete: false`. Schema 45 does not wire the legacy
no-target `provenance-repair --apply` command, which remains disabled, and does
not grant authority for OCR, source-wide reingest, source-wide deletion,
deployment, or customer execution.

The held candidate adds a separate exact-target orchestrator for
`provenance-repair --target`. It accepts one owner-supplied source-relative
locator only for the manifest's enabled `corpora.local_folder` and a registered
upload source. It refuses target inference, multiple extraction records,
unreliable or incomplete text, and every OCR path. The orchestrator derives its
private retrieval query from the prepared native text and never sends that
query, the locator, the local root, original hashes, document identities, or
sealed internal receipts to public output.

Both preview and apply obtain the existing source-ingest lease before any
private manifest-content, source-file, credential, network, or Brain-state
access. Under the lease they recompute the canonical manifest and source
configuration, root identity, original bytes, local extraction, package runtime
fingerprint, active product and schema 46 or newer, vector readiness, complete authenticated
source inventory, and complete authenticated observation history. The history
walk uses one stable snapshot and is bracketed by a fresh inventory read so a
previous accepted resolution or a concurrent new gap cannot be hidden by a
partial page. Every mutation and retry asserts that the same lease is still
owned. The lease is held through final verification and released on every exit.

A pure sealed target plan is design evidence only. It cannot advertise apply
authority. Only the packaged orchestrator can attach current executor proof
after all of the leased checks pass and produce a public state-bound approval
hash. Apply reacquires the lease and rebuilds that proof before comparing the
hash. It sends one prepared single-record ingest envelope, reconciles stale
members only within that original's exact structural family, and never updates
a source receipt, source cursor, or source-wide removal plan.

The mutation sequence is fixed: exact-target ingest, exact-family reconcile,
shared vector drain, schema-44 `result_family` record, schema-44
`result_family` verify, schema-45 `accepted_resolution` record, then schema-45
`accepted_resolution` verify. Every response is validated as a closed receipt
before the next step. The accepted record is impossible before the portable
family has both been stored and freshly verified. Replay is idempotent only for
the exact same state; stale or mismatched receipts, recovery without local
activation, lease loss, response drift, or a changed family fail closed and
require a new preview. After recovery, portable history remains but the old
approval and local activation do not. A new leased run must establish fresh
deployment-local proof before reactivation.

This lane has deliberately visible side effects. Exact-family reconciliation
can remove stale siblings only from the selected family. The global drain can
process unrelated work already present in the shared outbox. Reingest and drain
can create embeddings. The result-family record and verify plus
accepted-resolution record and verify each perform two private production
retrieval calls, for eight probes total, and may create ordinary aggregate
usage records. None of those effects widens the receipt beyond one original or
establishes whole-source completeness.

The new-computer continuity report composes that same authenticated source
inventory with local-only observations. It reads the exact manifest, durable
owner credential, connector stores, declared local roots, LaunchAgent status,
resume state, current package entrypoint, technician skill, and Claude Code/Codex MCP
registrations. It never accepts an ambient admin key or credential-store mode,
enters a Wrangler session, opens a browser, refreshes a source, or writes. Its
JSON projects every observation onto four states: `ready`, `missing`,
`unproven`, or `inapplicable`. Raw paths, source and provider identities,
Cloudflare resource IDs, credential values, and cursor values remain inside the
inspection boundary. Since the source inventory masks cursors and does not echo
the manifest's Cloudflare resource bindings, legacy checkpoint continuity and
the exact deployed-resource match stay `unproven` until a future keyed receipt
can prove them. The current package's existence and self-declared version are
local facts only. Public release integrity and currency require an independently
resolved release target and artifact receipt, so the report also keeps that
claim `unproven`.

The Owner Financial Map has a narrow technician read/preview contract under
`/api/admin/brain/financial-map/` and a separate private review/confirmation
contract under `/api/owner/financial-map/`. Migration 0041 adds no inferred
history or backfill. Read and preview accept the durable admin credential or
the exact owner session. The complete private review, passkey options, and
activation require the exact unscoped owner app session with no admin-key,
CLI, or MCP fallback. The old admin passkey and activation routes return 410.
Every preview is a full closed snapshot of
the current entity and account inventory, any owner-declared expected rows that
are not in the ledger, and a finite entity-year horizon. Each entity-year names
its filing-unit, return, form, K-1, books, payroll, and expected-source
obligations. Opaque local map IDs keep that declared denominator separate from
nullable ledger evidence. Rows and current values are represented by
database-salt HMAC-bound references and hashes.
The immutable activation chain binds the map hash, denominator hash, inventory
generation, and one prior head. Local MCP can read and create an expiring
non-authoritative preview only. It has no activation operation. No map route
rewrites the ledger, sources, tax records, books, payroll, or accounts.

Google OAuth uses Keychain by default on macOS and a protected file under
`~/.brain/` on other supported paths. Scheduler logs and locks also live under
the private per-user `.brain` directory. These files are runtime evidence, not
repository fixtures.

Source content travels from the owner's source through their machine to their
Worker and storage in their Cloudflare account. The installer operator does not
receive a central corpus copy. Cloudflare Workers AI handles standard embedding
and answer generation inside that account. An external answer or rerank provider
is used only when the manifest explicitly selects it and its Worker secret is
allowed.

One install has one operator boundary and multiple app principals. Anyone
holding the install's admin key has whole-install authority. Owner passkeys can
reach the owned workspace. Scoped sessions can reach only exact documents named
by active grants, and new documents are owner-only until granted. Folder names,
source names, categories, and ordinary metadata can narrow retrieval but never
create permission. If D1 grant or entity authority is unavailable, retrieval
fails closed rather than reporting an empty corpus.

## Support journal

Recognized CLI failures attempt to write one immutable event under
`~/.brain/support/events/`. An event contains only product version, platform,
architecture, Node major, command, connector class, typed error code, timestamp,
random event ID, and an optional hash derived from validated product source
location.

The journal module has no network path and does not accept raw diagnostic text.
Preview and export use the same bounded canonical bytes. Retention is best
effort and cannot replace the original command result. `support-recovery.mjs`
maps every stable code to a human title, protection statement, retry state, next
steps, and technician boundary. `brain support --explain` renders it without
reading the journal; its JSON form lets a local assistant follow the same
reviewed contract. A future central support path must remain opt-in, show exact
payload bytes, and use a separate write-only credential rather than the admin
key or Cloudflare token.

When adding a failure mode, update the classifier, allowed journal schema,
recovery catalog, privacy and CLI tests, hiccup rehearsal when applicable, and
troubleshooting runbook together. Prefer a stable, typed issue identity over
matching mutable human wording.

## Verification layers

| Layer | Question answered |
|---|---|
| `brain doctor` | Can this machine run the installer and its required tools? |
| `brain verify` | Can this scoped credential reach the exact intended account and services? |
| `brain health` | Is the expected Worker version live, authenticated, and operational, including vector backlog? |
| `brain test` | Do reachability, data, retrieval, safety, and operations pass in dependency order? |
| `brain diagnose` | Is the corpus missing text, duplicated, orphaned, truncated, skewed, or out of sync with Vectorize? |
| `brain eval` | Does this install retrieve the required documents, refuse unsupported questions honestly, and avoid regression? |
| `npm test` and CI | Does shared product behavior pass offline on supported operating systems and Node versions? |
| Live field gates | Does the real connector, scale, scheduler, or account lifecycle work outside mocks? |

The D1 diagnostic's chunk-integrity lane is a bounded snapshot, not a collection
of independent whole-table aggregates. It fixes one integer chunk-id high-water
mark, visits that range once with keyset pages, and fuses the exact total, blank,
oversized, orphan, document-source mismatch, and zone-projection counts in each
page. Opening and closing schema, outbox-generation, corpus-stat, source-event,
source-count, and vector-projection markers cheaply detect supported concurrent
corpus changes. The bounded zone command records its source-authoritative
assignment and projection-repair page in the same transaction, so a same-zone
repair cannot evade the marker. Any changed marker, failed page, coverage gap,
or exhausted statement/page budget makes the additive report `complete: false`,
removes page-derived counts, and names the skipped checks. Store parity runs
only at a verified empty-queue cut, because provider acceptance can become
visible asynchronously, and then requires exact count equality with no
percentage tolerance. The renderer cannot issue a clean verdict from partial
evidence. Expensive duplicate-text and per-document outlier groupings are
explicitly unobservable at large scale until maintained hashes or aggregates
make them indexable.

The eval golden set is per install. It should include answerable single-document
questions, multi-document questions, hard paraphrases, near-miss entities, and
questions the corpus genuinely cannot answer. Retrieval is scored with recall at
fixed depth and MRR, raw and deduplicated by document. Repeated runs measure
variance before a small score change is treated as real.

An optional private corpus contract supplies the independent expected-source
boundary that search cannot infer from itself. Before credential use, the
evaluator validates a stable owner-only file, its complete connector snapshots,
and its binding to the manifest client slug. During the normal read-only corpus
bracket it compares each expected logical family with the authenticated D1
family inventory. The evaluator sends cursors only in JSON POST bodies, refuses
redirected responses, and derives the source set from live documents instead of
denormalized statistics.
Results retain only aggregate counts, declared slice labels,
hashes, and typed stage codes. Private paths, source identities, document names,
versions, and content never enter shareable artifacts. This proves logical
presence and expected policy absence. Content-version and extraction equality
remain not observable until a richer read-only snapshot exists.
