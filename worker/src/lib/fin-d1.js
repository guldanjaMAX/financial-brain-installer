/**
 * fin-d1 — the read path over the structured financial ledger (migration 0015).
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR
 *
 * The document corpus answers questions by retrieving text. This module answers
 * them by reading rows: what accounts exist, how far their records reach, which
 * periods are matched, which figures disagree, what falls due, and what the
 * ledger could NOT read. Those are the questions the client-facing screens ask,
 * and none of them is answerable from prose.
 *
 * THREE RULES THIS FILE KEEPS, AND WHY
 *
 * 1. THE WIRE NEVER CARRIES A CLIENT WORD. Everything returned here is either a
 *    stored enum value, a date, an integer in minor units, or a count. The
 *    product's five client-facing outcome words are a rendering decision that
 *    belongs to the surface showing them, and the same stored state legitimately
 *    renders differently depending on whether the screen it lands on offers the
 *    control that would fix it. Emitting the word here would freeze that
 *    decision in the wrong repository and make every future disagreement a
 *    deploy. So this file emits facts and the enums the translation layer
 *    already consumes.
 *
 * 2. NO TOTAL WITHOUT ITS COVERAGE. Every aggregate returns what it covered, out
 *    of what, and what it could not read, in the same object. A figure that
 *    quietly spans only the accounts that happened to be readable is the most
 *    expensive kind of wrong: it looks sourced. The shape makes the gap
 *    impossible to drop without deleting a field.
 *
 * 3. ABSENT IS NOT EMPTY. An install that has not run migration 0015 has no
 *    ledger at all; an install that has run it and holds nothing has an empty
 *    one. Those are different answers and a client is entitled to both, so every
 *    entry point reports `ledger_installed` and never conflates a missing table
 *    with a quiet month.
 *
 * FAILURE BEHAVIOUR: a read that throws returns `unavailable: true` with empty
 * rows rather than propagating. A financial screen that cannot reach its records
 * must say so; it must not take down the page, and it must never render as
 * "nothing owed, nothing due".
 *
 * PRIVACY: nothing here reads or returns a credential. Connector access tokens
 * live in connector-owned tables and are never joined into a ledger read.

/**
 * The dated cash position, one account at a time.
 *
 * THIS IS THE QUERY MOST LIKELY TO PRODUCE A CONFIDENT WRONG NUMBER, so it is
 * built to refuse rather than to compose:
 *
 *  - only deposit accounts are considered. A card balance is money owed and
 *    never enters this figure, and the accounts it excludes are RETURNED with
 *    the reason so nothing disappears silently;
 *  - A CASH POSITION IS A POINT IN TIME. Every figure summed here is dated to
 *    the SAME day. An account whose most recent confirmed figure is a month
 *    older is not quietly added in at its stale value; it moves to `missing`
 *    carrying the date its records actually reach. Summing a July balance and a
 *    June one produces a number that is true of no moment that ever existed, and
 *    it is the most plausible-looking way this function could be wrong. The
 *    default as-of is the most recent confirmed figure across the accounts
 *    considered; a caller wanting a period-end position passes that period's end;
 *  - an account with no confirmed figure at all goes to `missing` with why, and
 *    its absence is visible in the covered-of-considered counts;
 *  - a proposed or unparsed figure is never summed. A figure the extractor was
 *    unsure of is not a balance;
 *  - a mix of currencies returns no total at all rather than adding units that
 *    are not the same unit.
 *
 * An excluded account returns its `last_confirmed_as_of` DATE and deliberately
 * not its amount, so there is no stale figure sitting in the payload for a
 * caller to add back in by accident.
