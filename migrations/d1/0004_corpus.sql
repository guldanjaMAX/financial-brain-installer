-- 0004_corpus — the brain's own storage, on Cloudflare alone.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--
-- The v1 worker called Supabase for retrieval, which forced every client to
-- own a second vendor account. The install model is one Cloudflare account per
-- client, so a Supabase dependency breaks it twice: another account to create,
-- and a free tier that PAUSES after inactivity, which for a brain queried a few
-- times a week means a brain that is asleep exactly when someone needs it.
--
-- So text and keyword search live here in D1, and vectors live in Vectorize,
-- both inside the client's own account.
--
-- SHAPED FOR PORTABILITY, DELIBERATELY
--
-- These tables use the names, columns and semantics shared by the product's
-- retrieval contract. That keeps imports, exports and disaster recovery as a
-- data copy rather than a redesign, without declaring an unmeasured corpus-size
-- cutoff as an architectural limit.
--
-- The one rule that makes it work: chunk_uid is the ONLY join key that ever
-- leaves this system. It is the Vectorize vector id, the D1 unique key, the
-- future Postgres primary key, and the id in every citation the brain emits.
-- The integer rowid exists solely because FTS5 external-content mode requires
-- one, and it must never appear in an API response, a log line, or a citation.

-- The outbox exists ONLY because there is no transaction across D1 and
-- Vectorize.
--
-- Postgres commits the text and its vector in one statement. Here they are two
-- systems, and Vectorize writes are explicitly asynchronous: a write-ahead log
-- first, the index later. So a crash between the D1 insert and the Vectorize
-- upsert leaves a chunk that keyword search can find and vector search cannot,
-- with nothing to say so.
--
-- Every chunk therefore lands here first and is cleared only once Vectorize has
-- acknowledged it. Anything still pending is a chunk the vector index does not
-- have yet, which makes the gap visible and repairable instead of silent.
