/**
 * Preflight for an install.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * A clean-room rehearsal on 2026-08-17 found three defects that only appear when
 * you run the whole sequence from nothing: provisioning could not reach Vectorize
 * with any API token, secrets failed because the worker did not exist yet, and a
 * false drift warning fired on every healthy install. Every one of those would
 * have surfaced live, in front of a client, in the first ten minutes.
 *
 * Doctor's job is to find all of that BEFORE the session starts, and to say what
 * to do about each in words the person reading can act on. A check that reports
 * "failed" without a fix has done half a job.
 *
 * EVERY CHECK IS INDEPENDENT AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE. Doctor never creates anything.

 *   - An API token CAN reach the Vectorize API. A full-access account-owned
 *     token listed indexes successfully. So the earlier blanket claim that "no
 *     API token can reach Vectorize" was wrong, and is retracted here.
 *   - The tokens that failed simply lacked the permission. Every one of them
 *     returned `Authentication error 10000`, which is indistinguishable from an
 *     invalid token and is why this was misdiagnosed as a platform limit.
 *   - On 2026-08-23 a user-owned token scoped to one account with Vectorize Edit
 *     created a 768-dimensional index and all six metadata indexes through the

 * silently: the first load happens in whatever order someone picks under
 * install-day pressure, usually chronological, and the first impression is
 * made by the archive instead of the working set. After handoff the ordering
 * decision is spent, so a completed install stops warning.
