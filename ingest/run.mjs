/**
 * Walk a folder, extract text, and load it into the client's brain.
 *
 * DESIGN NOTES THAT MATTER
 *
 * RESUMABLE BY DEFAULT. A first import is tens of thousands of files and will be
 * interrupted: a laptop sleeps, a token expires, someone closes the lid. State
 * is written after every batch, keyed by content hash, so a re-run skips what
 * already landed and costs one read per file rather than a re-embed. Re-running
 * is the normal way to finish, not a recovery procedure.
 *
 * EVERY SKIP IS RECORDED WITH ITS REASON. A file that silently does not make it
 * in produces a brain that is confidently ignorant of it. The run ends with a
 * breakdown by reason, and the state file keeps it, so "why isn't my contract in
 * there" has an answer.
 *
 * PRIVATE PREFIXES ARE ENFORCED HERE. The manifest has advertised
 * safety.private_path_prefixes since the beginning and nothing honoured it. This
 * is where it becomes true.

 * corpus has 3,646 extractable files, projecting ~540MB of live string data
 * before the first byte is sent. At the tens-of-thousands scale a real client
 * has, it is several gigabytes: past V8's default old space on a laptop, where
 * it dies with a raw heap-limit abort that no error handler can catch.
 *
 * The second failure was quieter and just as bad. Resume state is only written
 * after a batch is SENT, so an interrupt during the extraction phase threw away
 * every minute of work and restarted from zero, while the module header
 * promised that a re-run "skips what already landed".
 *
 * Streaming fixes both: peak memory is one batch, progress is continuous
 * instead of a long silence, and an interrupt costs at most one batch.

 * downstream (credential scan, batching, resume state) still sees one item at a
 * time, in order, exactly as before.
 *
 * Order is not cosmetic. Resume state and the document family plan reason
 * about "everything before this batch has landed". An out-of-order yield could
 * record a later item as done while an earlier one was still in flight, and an
 * interrupt at that moment would skip the earlier item on every future run.
 *
 * Errors: a rejection surfaces when its item's turn comes, so the caller sees
 * the same failure at the same position it would have seen serially. Items
 * already in flight are allowed to settle first, so none is left behind as an
 * unhandled rejection, and no further items are started.
