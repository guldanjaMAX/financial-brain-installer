 * Delete the Cloudflare resources one TEST brain install created.

 * a D1 database and a Vectorize index behind forever. That caps how many cold
 * installs are affordable, and it is the gap REC-02 asks us to close.
 *
 * This is deliberately an ALLOWLIST tool. It deletes exactly the names you
 * pass and nothing else. The test account is not empty: it also hosts a live
 * preview brain, so a "delete everything that looks like a brain" sweep here
 * would be destructive. Refusing to guess is the whole design.
 *
 *   node scripts/teardown-test-brain.mjs --name brain-test-run-1
 *   node scripts/teardown-test-brain.mjs --name brain-test-run-1 --commit
 *
 * Dry run is the default. Nothing is deleted until --commit is passed.
 * Token: CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, or macOS Keychain (-a brain-test -s cf-api-token).
 * Account: CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID, or resolved from the token when it can see
 * exactly one account.
